Contribution
============

This document is an extension to the generic `Anuket Project Operations
and Procedures
<https://wiki.anuket.io/display/HOME/Anuket+Project+Operations+and+Procedures>`__
and describes contribution rules to the Anuket specifications, that are
the set of documents maintained in this repository.

Permission levels
-----------------

There are different permissions (levels) available for contributing into
the Anuket specifications: - **Outside Collaborators**: This includes
general public. - Outside collaborators can create issues and add
comments to issues and Pull Requests. - **Read, Triage, Write, and
Maintain** Permissions, which are explained in
`here <https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization>`__,
will be assigned as follows: - **Read** will be assigned to those who
want to create issues, join the discussions, receive notifications, and
provide feedback. - **Triage** will be assigned to active contributors
who create issues, pull requests and review them. - **Writes** will be
assigned to sub-project Co-Leads to allow them to manage issues and pull
request, approve them and be auto requested for review. - **Maintain**
will be assigned to sub-project Leads to allow them to merge PRs into
the repository.

Labels
------

Every Issue and PR should be tagged with one or more of the following
labels to indicate their status and for the automation pipelines to
apply the correct Anuket processes.

-  **Backlog**: The Issue will be addressed in future releases..
-  **Major/Minor**: The Issue or PR concerns a major or minor change..
-  **WIP**: The PR is still under development, no reviews/approvals are
   expected yet.
-  **Returned**: The issue/PR has been sent back to author (e.g. more
   information needed, not a high priority, no longer valid, etc). Only
   WSL or TSL can tag an issue/PR as Returned.
-  **Idle**: This label will be **automatically** applied (by a GitHub
   work flow or by WSL/TS Leads) to both issues/PRs to indicate that no
   activity has been observed on the issue/PR for some determined time
   frame. This triggers an action to close the issue/PR.
-  **Unresolved**: This label will be **automatically** applied to PRs
   to indicate that no consensus has been reached on the PR. This
   triggers an action to resolve the PR by the TSC.
-  **Forced**: This label will be **automatically** applied to PRs to
   indicate that the PR has been merged without following the default
   process (due to reasons identified below)

Issues
------

-  Title needs to be in the following format [SPx Chx] (if applicable).

   -  SPx: The name of the sub-project it is targeting.
   -  Chx: The name of the chapter it is targeting (if applicable).

-  Upon Creation, Issues must be correctly set with the correct
   **Project Name**.

   -  Project Name = Sub-project name.

-  Issues must be correctly set with the right labels and Milestone by
   the sub-project lead.

   -  Relevant Milestone for the upcoming release (M1 - M6).

-  Contributors can assign an unassigned issue to themselves if they
   would like to work on them
-  Sub-project leads have the responsibility to assign stalling or
   priority issues to individuals to address them.
-  Sub-project leads may label an issue as “**Returned**” to request
   further information or to decide not to work on it.

Pull Requests
-------------

-  Minor editorial change PRs can be raised without a corresponding
   Issue, but must be labelled as “Minor”. Otherwise, PRs must only be
   created when there is an issue present and a decision to create a PR
   is made.
-  A PR must reference the issue it is resolving in the description
   field.

   -  using GitHub predefined keyword “Fixes Issue#” will automatically
      close the issue which the PR is resolving when it is merged.

-  A PR for an issue must only be created by the contributor assigned to
   the issue (either by self assignment or by the respective sub-project
   lead).
-  Only the person assigned (“assignee”) to a PR may edit it. The normal
   process is for others to make suggests in “Comments” but not directly
   edit a PR unless the assignee has granted another contributor
   permission to contribute directly to the PR.
-  A PR is recommended to only create/modify content within the scope of
   a single chapter in a single sub-project if possible.
-  A PR should only add/change content related to the issue associated
   with the PR.
-  Comments/sub-Conversations within a PR may only be marked Resolved
   by:

   - A) The originator of the sub-conversation.
   - B) The relevant sub-project lead or
   - C) An automated timeout of 1 week when there has been no
     additional comments after an update is posted to resolve the
     sub-thread.
   -  **The person responding to a sub-conversation shall not mark it as
      Resolved**.

-  All changes to an existing PRs shall be made through subsequent
   commits.

   -  **Do not modify an existing commit, create separate commits under
      the same PR**.
   -  After major changes to a PR reapproval is needed from all previous
      approvers
   -  PRs will be merged using “Squash and Merge” to enforce a linear
      commit history.

Pull Requests Approval Process
------------------------------

-  Once a PR is created, it needs to get the following approvals before
   it is merged into master.

   -  From at least three of contributors for that sub-project

      -  Approvers should be distributed equally among operators and
         vendors.

   -  From sub-project lead (to make sure consensus is reached).
   -  Sub-project lead can request additional approvals reviews.

      -  Recommendation is to use 4 approvals for complex PRs.

   -  2 business days waiting period should be applied before Final
      approval.

-  The selection of which contributor to approve a PR is made by the
   sub-project lead and should take those factors into consideration:

   -  Contributor needs to be actively discussing the PR to be selected
      for approval.

-  PRs will be merged automatically online by the sub-project lead or
   other committers of the sub-project once consensus is reached on the
   changes, all issues are resolved, and all of the required
   approvals/re-approvals are received.

   -  Sub-projects should have an agreed set of committers who are
      trusted with merging rights to the sub-projects.
      `CODEOWNERS <CODEOWNERS>`__ file should contain all the committers
      of the sub-projects including the sub-project lead.

-  The person creating the PR cannot be an approver and should not be
   the person performing the merge.
-  If a PR affects more than one sub-project or areas outside of the
   scope of the sub-projects the following approvals are needed:

   -  From the sub-project leads of the affected sub-projects or if the
      PR affects no sub-projects at least 3 contributors active in 3
      different sub-projects of Anuket specifications

   PR Approval Process

Idle Pull Requests Policy
-------------------------

Pull Requests will be automatically labled as “**Idle**” when: - No
engagement/activity (content, reviews, conversations) from author,
reviewers and sub-project contributors on non-merge ready PRs for 15
calendar days. - Personal holidays or public holidays will not be
counted. - One or more identified Reviewers (including WSL) are not
providing feedback/resolutions or approving the Pull Request for more
than 15 calender days.

Any Pull Requests that are labeled as “Idle” will be discussed during
Technical Steering Meeting to take a decision on, such as: - Close the
PR and label it as “**Returned**”. - “**Force**” Merging of the PR
without having full reviewers approvals due to their inactivity.

Unresolved Pull Requests Policy
-------------------------------

Pull Requests will be automatically labled as “**Unresolved**” (by
GitHub automation flow or a similar automation mechanism) when no
consensus is reached during approval process.

Any Pull Requests that are labeled as “**Unresolved**” will be discussed
during Technical Steering Comitee Meeting to take a decision on it by: -
Finding Common Grounds to come to consensus. - Follow Governance
Procedures to get consensus via voting mechanisms.
