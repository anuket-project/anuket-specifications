- **Introduction**

    Telco Edge is commonly coupled with 5G use cases, seen as one of the ingredients of the ultra-low latency/eMBB Network Slicing. The requirements for user plane Local Breakout / Termination are common mandating that VASs & Any Gi-LAN applications are locally hosted at the Edge.

    The Telco Edge is a perfect fit for centralized vRAN deployment and vDU/vCU hosting preserving the latency requirements.

    This section illustrates some selected use cases that are aligned with the technology evolution and aligned with the 5G business services offerings as well.

- **Use Case #1 - eMBB Network Slice with CDN**

  - **Business Objectives**
  
      Monetizing 5G network slicing by providing eMBB Network slice with distributed CDN as a Service providing UHD Streaming Experience, Video Optimization, Caching for Large files, and other Capabilities that can either bundled by the Network Slice offering or implicitly enabled by the operator.

  - **Targeted Segments**
  
    - B2C (Targeting high Tier Packages & Bundles)
    - Content Owners (Potential revenue sharing model)
    - MVNOs (Wholesale)
    - Stadiums and Venus.

  - **Architecture**
