2-Objective :

Based on CNTTâ€™s goal and purpose is to develop a robust cloud infrastructure model and define a limited set of discrete architectures  built on that model that can be tested and validated for use across the entire member community.

Extend CNTT's Scope beyond the Regional and National Data Center cloud infrastructures to the Edge. The Edge is a disruptive use case where CNTT can add value especially as there are a number of scattered initiatives under various Standard Development Organisations (SDO) and open source communities."

Edge Stream related activities :
-	To Harmonize the work under Standard Development bodies or  Open source communities 
-	To build Common Cloud infrastructure based on CNTT principles that can be consumed by any operator
-	To build Cloud infrastructure that can scale and cover the Edge Telco use cases that can help CSP to monetize the NFV/SDN journey
-  Modify the existing RM and RA-s so that they are aligned with the edge requirements
