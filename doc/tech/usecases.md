## 5.1 Edge

<a name="5.1.1"></a>
### 5.1.1 Executive Summary:

Edge computing, a disruptive technology, that should be considered for adoption by Digital Service Providers (DSP) as it is tightly linked with a number of use cases that monetize 5G. Thus, operators, cloud service providers, content providers and application developers are increasingly focussed on Edge computing.

Edge is considered as one of the main enablers to 5G use cases adoption. There are a number of 5G challenges that Edge will support solve so as to implement the 5G requirements defined by "ITU-2020 for 5G." Edge is required to support enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTCs) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (uRLLCs).

With respect to monetization, Edge will help DSPs with their Return on investment (ROI) on 5G and cloud as a number of new services require the Edge. For example, services such as Cloud Gaming, Assisted Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), 5G private networks, and vRAN.
