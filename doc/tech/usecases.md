## 5.1 Edge

3-Approach & Scope  : 

Edge Approach:
-	 All gaps under Reference Model , Reference Architecture 01 -OpenStack- , Reference Architecture 02 - K8s will be identified and Edge requirements will be fulfilled  under Reference Model , Reference Architecture 01 -OpenStack- , Reference Architecture 02 - K8s  

Edge scope under CNTT will cover :

-	Define Edge locations based on use case 
-	Define some guideline about external factors that can affect the edge like WAN latency based on telco use case 
-	Define VNF/CNF profiles (if needed) specific to Edge use cases such as profiles required for acceleration technologies 
-	Define resource requirements in terms of compute, storage and networking; new concepts, such as hyper converged infrastructure, can     be introduced
-	Define different Architecture models as no one size fits all"
-	

Out of Scope 

-	The API that can be exposed to 3rd party application developer 
-	The Architecture of VNF/CNF ( CNTT Guideline only )
-	Exact location of Edge deployment will vary by Operator 
-	latency may be vary based on operator transmission type (Microwave,Fixed),a well Transmission network reachability and architecture (Backhaul,front haul, Mid haul)
-	Onboarding of VNF/CNF on edges cloud infrastructure
