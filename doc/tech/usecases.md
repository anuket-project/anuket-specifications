Principles:

This section introduces some principles that should be followed during the definition and development of the Edge scope to be covered in CNTT Reference Model, Reference Architectures, Reference Implementations and Reference Conformance test suites.

A main principle is that we shall not re-define a new branch of CNTT and avoid to re-inventing what other organizations already have . we are following the same principles that defined in existing [Reference Model Principles](../ref_model/chapters/chapter01.md#13-principles), the [Reference Architecture Principles](../ref_arch#principles) and the Network Principles.
