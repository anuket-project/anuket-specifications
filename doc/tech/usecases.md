## 5.1 Edge

1- Executive Summary:

Edge computing consider on of disruptive  technology should be considered by any DSP as it is tightly linked with a lot of use cases that can monetize the 5G adoption , so a lot of CSP , Punblic  cloud , content provider and application developer focus on Edge 

Edge consider one of main enabler to 5G use cases adoption  , as there is a lot of 5G challenges that Edge will support to solve them , So to achieved 5G requirements  that define by ITU-2020 for 5G , To have enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) , massive machine-type communications (mMTCs) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (uRLLCs) Edge is required 


In term of monetization Edge will help SDP to start have ROI of Cloud /NFV as there is a lot use cases can be developed at the Edge as Cloud Gamming , AR/VR , 5G private networks ,..


In section under CNTT  , we try to develop  and define solid Model and Architecture to become the defacto of Edge in Telco
