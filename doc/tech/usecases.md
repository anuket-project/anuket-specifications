2-Objective :


Based on CNTT’s Project goals & Purpose was formulated is to develop a robust infrastructure model and define a limited discrete set of architectures built on that model that can be tested and validated for use across the entire member community. 

CNTT Scope is extending beyond the Cloud infrastructure that should build into the Regional or National Data Center  but it extended to the Edge , which CNTT consider it as a disruptive  approach and use case that CNTT will add value especially there is a lot of scattered project/Initiative either under Standard Development bodies or  Open source communities

Edge Stream related activities :
-	To Harmonize the work under Standard Development bodies or  Open source communities 
-	To build Common Cloud infrastructure based on CNTT principles that can be consumed by any operator
-	To build Cloud infrastructure that can scale and cover the Edge Telco use cases that can help CSP to monetize the NFV/SDN journey
-  Modify the existing RM and RA-s so that they are aligned with the edge requirements
