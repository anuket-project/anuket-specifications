## 1.1 Introduction

<a name="1.1.1"></a>
### 1.1.1 About Reference Implementation

This document includes the requirement and deployment details of the the first reference implementation for CNTT. This first reference implementation
 follows the requirement and architecture design of the [OpenStack Based Reference Architecture](../../../ref_arch/openstack/chapters). This document
 will includes the detailed requirement of RI for CNTT, NFVi configurations according to the requirement of RA and each different flavor of VNF, Lab
 requirements for RI deployment and validation and installer requirement. This reference implementation will fully reveal the capabilities and features
 defined in CNTT RM and RA, and thus will be utilized as 'golden NFVi' in the Reference Compliance of CNTT.

 In order to promote quick deployment of RI and not re-invent wheels, the CNTT community works closly with OPNFV, utilizing and evolving OPNFV CI
 pipeline and installer automation and testing automation capabilities. Detailed collaboration and contribution to OPNFV will be concluded in the
 following sessions.

### 1.1.2 Relationship with other communities

1. Relationship with OPNFV

Current collaboration with OPNFV includes:

a) OPNFV CIRV project.

This project is the 'landing' place for CNTT in OPNFV. It is responsible for driving activities of CNTT within OPNFV, working with multiple projects,
including Airship, Functest, Dovetail, and ext.. The project team is working closely with the CNTT RI WSs.

Detailed infomation of this project can be found here:
https://wiki.opnfv.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=47284396


b) OPNFV Infra WG.

The CNTT RI WSs work closely with the OPNFV Infra WG for the requirement of Labs and Installers. The detailed requirements explained in
[Chapter 4](ref_impl/cntt-ri/chapters/chapter04.md) and [Chapter 5](ref_impl/cntt-ri/chapters/chapter05.md) of this document are discussed and
reviewed with the Infra WG, and will be used as guideline for detailed development work in Infra WG.

c) OPNFV Testing WG.

The CNTT RI WSs works with the Testing WG for manifest testing for the Reference implementation.

d) Airship Project.

The Airship Project will be used as the intaller for the first RI.

2. Relationship with OVP

This RI will act as 'golden NFVi' for the test of VNFs within OVP. The figure below shows verification process of OVP and its relationship with CNTT.
The verification process for OVP can be classified as 'cloud platform world' and 'MANO world', while the 'cloud platform world' mainly focusing on the
capability and features for the platform, and the interoperobility of platform with VNFs, and the 'MANO' world mainly focusing on MANO related VNF features
and interoperobiligy.

**CNTT will focus on the 'cloud platform world' of OVP**, through the following aspects:

a) Providing CNTT verification labs with standard hardware/software for cloud platform and VNF verification

b) Providing Reference Implementation as Golden NFVi for interoperobility testing with VNFs

c) Providing Reference Compliance test requirements and test cases for compliance test for both NFVi and VNFs

## 1.2 Terminology

Terminology in this document will follow [CNTT Terminology](ref_model/chapters/glossary.md).


<a name="1.3"></a>
## 1.3 Scope

The scope of this document is illustrate as follows:

a) generate eco-system requirements for the establishement of Reference Implementation, including Labs, toolings, installers, releases and automation
requirements

b) Provide detailed discription file definition for installers, VNF features, and etc..

c) Provide detailed Lab criteria and operations

d) Provide a Run-book for the first RI, which includes detailed steps for the deployment and configuration.

e) Provide detailed design for automation of deployment and testing, provide continuous integration and delivery pipeline for RI

f) Gap analysis with required actions for existing eco-system within LFN/OPNFV community projects

## 1.4 Roadmap

This document is planned to release on Jan. 2020, while the first of RI code (including installers, manifest test cases, automation CI) will follow the release
routin of OPNFV Release J.
