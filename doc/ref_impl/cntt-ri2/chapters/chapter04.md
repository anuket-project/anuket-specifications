## 4.1 Introduction

This chapter describes the steps to install Kubernetes based Reference Implementation (RI-2). The entire installation is divided into two stages - Host provisioning and Kubernetes provisioning. The host provisioning stage is provided here for information only and can be skipped when using Bare Metal Providers like Packet, etc. The Kubernetes provisioning stage is agnostic to the host provisioning stage, in that there is no dependency between the installer used for the Kubernetes provisioning stage and any tools used in the host provisioning stage.

## 4.2 Prerequisites

Before attempting the installation, please ensure that all requirements described in [Chapter 3](./chapter03.md) are met.
(More details to follow)

### 4.3.1 Host Provisioning

Host provisioning is the operation of preparing a host before the software stack can be installed on them. This includes (and not limited to) installing an operating system, configuring network so that the hosts are reachable via SSH, configuring storage, etc.

A former OPNFV bare-metal provisioner XCI, now referred to as [Cloud Infra Automation Framework](https://docs.nordix.org/submodules/infra/engine/docs/user-guide.html#framework-user-guide) and hosted by Nordix Labs has been used in the host provisioning stage. The mentioned framework uses [Bifrost](https://docs.openstack.org/bifrost/latest/) for provisioning virtual and bare-metal hosts. It performs this automated deployment by using Ansible playbooks and [Ironic](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/).

Before initiating a deployment, two configuration templates, referred to as POD Descriptor File (PDF) and Installer Descriptor File (IDF) in OPNFV terminology need to be defined. Both PDF and IDF files are modeled as YAML schema.

A PDF is a hardware configuration template that includes hardware characteristics of the jumphost host and the set of compute/controller hosts. For each host, the following characteristics should be defined:
- CPU, disk and memory information
- Remote management parameters
- Network interfaces list including name, MAC address, IP address, link speed

IDF includes information about network information required by the installer. All the networks along with possible VLAN, DNS, and gateway information should be defined here.

More details regarding these descriptor files as well as their schema are very well documented in [RI-1 Chapter 8](../../cntt-ri/chapters/chapter08.md#opnfv-descriptor-files-1).

After filling in the PDF and IDF with correct information, the user needs to generate SSH keypair, add a user to the sudo group and have passwordless sudo enabled. After this the deployment can be initiated by cloning the repo, navigating to the engine directory and running the deploy command

`./deploy.sh -o <OStype>-p file:///<pdf.yaml> -i file:///<idf.yaml> -l provision`

Currently, Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7.8 are supported (default Ubuntu 18.04). Support for other operating systems can be added as well depending on the requirements.

After the hosts have been provisioned successfully, one can set up host networking for Kubernetes and run Kubernetes provisioning tooling from CNF Testbed or Intelâ€™s BMRA playbooks to configure and install k8s and other plugins (Refer 4.3.2)

<a name="4.3.2"></a>
### 4.3.2 Kubernetes Provisioning

> Add detailed description of current K8s provisioning

<a name="4.4"></a>
## 4.4 Validation of the Reference Implementation

> Describe the steps to run through to validate the RI.  Will need automated tests available and a simple way to run them.


<a name="4.5"></a>
## 4.5 Automation Tooling

> Describe the automation tooling used and any specific configurations needed.
