## 1.1 Introduction

<a name="1.1.1"></a>
### 1.1.1 About the Kubernetes Reference Implementation

This document includes the requirements and deployment details of the the Kubernetes-based Reference Implementation (RI). This RI will conform to the architecture specification as defined in the [Kubernetes Based Reference Architecture (RA)](../../../ref_arch/kubernetes/README.md), including alignment with the principles and requirements of the [Reference Model](../../../ref_model/README.md).  

The RI will be used as follows:
* To develop the Reference Conformance (RC) document, which will document the tests that can be run against the RI or any Vendor Implementation (VI) to check conformance with the Kubernetes RA.
* By software vendors to be able to install Kubernetes platforms in their own environments in order to develop against the RI

In order to promote the quick deployment of the RI and avoid duplicating effort across communities, the RI community works closely with CNCF TUG, OVP, ONAP and TIP communities.
