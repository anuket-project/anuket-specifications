## Anuket Project Policies for Managing Non-Conforming Technologies

There are multiple situations where a policy, comprised of one or more compromises and/or transitions is required to address technology that does not presently conform to the Anuket Project mandates or strategy, and hence requires explicit direction to prescribe how the situation will be treated in the present, as well as in the future. This informs application designers how RC will react when encountering such technologies during the qualification process, including flagging warnings and potentially errors which could prevent issuance of a certification badge. 


### Feature Availability
One such case is where the Anuket Project strategically deems a given capability as mandatory, but the feature is a roadmap item, under development or otherwise unavailable. To address this scenario, a policy can be created to recognise the current state of the technology, and identify a Time Point (TP) in VNF Evolution when the feature will become mandatory for RC purposes.

### Current Anuket Project Policies

The following sets of compromises and transition plans comprise the policy for each technology subject to this document.

Be aware the compromises and transition plans contained herein, are directly related to factors which are subject to change with the evolution of technology, with changes in industry direction, with changes in standards, etc. Hence, **the policies are subject to change without notice**, and the reader is advised to consult the latest online Github revision of this chapter. All locally stored, printed or other copies should be considered obsolete.

> **Note to Authors:** Status should be set to "Proposed" when initial content is entered. Once alignment is attained following vetting and discussion, status should be set to "Aligned". Immediately prior to merge, status should be set to "In Force". When amending previously approved language, status should be changed from "In Force" to "In Force (Pending Changes)", followed by "Aligned" and ultimately, "In Force".
