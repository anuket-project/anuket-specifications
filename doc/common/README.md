## CNTT Technical Policies and Transition Plan

There are multiple situations where a [policy](./policies.md), comprised of one or more compromises and/or transitions is required to address technology that does not presently conform to CNTT mandates or strategy, and hence requires explicit direction to prescribe how the situation will be treated in the present, as well as in the future. This informs application designers how RC will react when encountering such technologies during the qualification process, including flagging warnings and potentially errors which could prevent issuance of a conformance badge.
