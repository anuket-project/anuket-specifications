Anuket Project Technical Policies and Transition Plan
-----------------------------------------------------

There are multiple situations where a :policy, comprised of
one or more compromises and/or transitions is required to address technology
that does not presently conform to the Anuket Project mandates or strategy,
and hence requires explicit direction to prescribe how the situation will be
treated in the present, as well as in the future. This informs workload
designers how the Reference Conformance testing will respond when encountering
such technologies during the qualification process, including flagging
warnings and potentially errors which could prevent issuance of a conformance
badge.
