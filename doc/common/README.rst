Anuket Project Technical Policies and Transition Plan
-----------------------------------------------------

There are multiple situations where a :doc:`policy <policies>`, comprised of one or more compromises and/or transitions is required to address technology that does not presently conform to the Anuket Project mandates or strategy, and hence requires explicit direction to prescribe how the situation will be treated in the present, as well as in the future. This informs workload designers how the Reference Conformance testing will respond when encountering such technologies during the qualification process, including flagging warnings and potentially errors which could prevent issuance of a conformance badge.

Other Policies

Relevant Technologies
---------------------

There are different technologies used and specified by the Anuket Project specifications. The `technologies section <./technologies.md>`__ describes the relevant technologies for the Anuket Project and clarifies the Anuket Project position about them.
