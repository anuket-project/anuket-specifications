## 5.1 Introduction
Consensus decision making is the model adopted by CNTT for all decisions taken within CNTT. This is essential for the success of CNTT and the buying needed from all parties involved in the community. In scenarios where disagreements are found, a reasonable effort shall be taken to identify the core cause of disagreements and work on a compromise that satisfies all parties involved in the discussion. 

However, in scenarios where an agreement can not be reached, a voting process will be taken place to find a way forward.

## 5.2 Voting representatives

Before any voting can take place, a voting representative list<sup>1</sup> shall be maintained that contains a list of individuals representing their corresponding organisation. Each organisation should only identify a single voting representative.

Being on the voting representative list **doesn't** mean the right to vote, the right to vote will be identified via the following criteria<sup>2</sup>:

- The organisation with a voting representative must have people directly associated with it physically attended at least **one** F2F workshop in the 6 months period prior to the voting event.
- The organisation with a voting representative must have people directly associated with it attended at least **five** CNTT meetings in the 3 months period prior to the voting event.
- The organisation with a voting representative must have people directly associated with it who had at least **two** Issues on GitHub assigned to them that resulted in the issues being resolved in the 3 months period prior to the voting event.
- The organisation with a voting representative must have people directly associated with it created at least **two** Pull Requests on GitHub in the 3 months period prior to the voting event.
- The organisation with a voting representative must have people directly associated with it provided at least **two** reviews on Pull Requests on GitHub in the 3 months period prior to the voting event.
  - A review on a PR is either an approval, a request for change, or a comment.
- Individuals who doesn't present an organisation will not have voting right.
