## 5.1 Introduction

Consensus decision making is the model adopted by CNTT for all decisions taken within CNTT. Buy in from all community member organisations is essential for the success of CNTT. 

In situations where consensus cannot be reached, reasonable efforts shall be made to identify and address the core root causes of the disagreements. If, in spite of these efforts, an agreement cannot be reached, the voting process, described below in Section 5.3, shall be undertaken to resolve the issue.

## 5.2 Voting representatives

Each CNTT member organisation shall nominate a single voting representative. A list of voting representatives shall be maintained within CNTT<sup>1</sup>.

Being on the voting representative list **doesn't** mean the right to vote. The following criteria<sup>2</sup> shall be used to identify eligible voting representatives prior to a voting event. To be eligible, the voting representative’s organization must have had people from their organization (or directly associated with them<sup>2</sup>) collectively satisfy the conditions below:

1. to have physically attended at least **one** F2F workshop in the 6 months period prior to the voting event;
1. to have attended at least **five** CNTT meetings in the 3 months period prior to the voting event;
1. to have had at least **two** Issues on GitHub assigned to them that resulted in the issues being resolved in the 3 months period prior to the voting event;
1. to have created at least **two** Pull Requests on GitHub in the 3 months period prior to the voting event.
    - Pull Requests created must contain meaningful commits (not minor).
1. to have created at least **two** reviews on Pull Requests on GitHub in the 3 months period prior to the voting event where a review on a PR is either an approval, a request for change, or a comment.

<sup>2)</sup>The criteria will be checked and the voting representative list will be updated prior any voting event when the voting process kicks in.

<sup>3)</sup> Individuals who don't present an organisation will not have voting right.
