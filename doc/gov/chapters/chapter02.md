- **Guide To Getting Started**

  - **How do I start the process of becoming a participant?** Onboarding starts as soon as you submit a request to join CNTT via email to cntt-gov@lists.opnfv.org. You will receive additional information such as links to the CNTT Getting Started wiki and additional onboarding materials.
  
  - **How long will it take to onboard?** The onboarding process will take approximately one hour of your time initially.
  
  - **What will I learn about during onboarding process?** You’ll get an overview of the CNTT mission and goals, community organizational structures and processes, as well as technology development status and roadmaps. Additionally, you’ll be made aware of participant responsibilities and legal obligations. Finally, you’ll be provided with support and logistical information you’ll need to join the community.

  - **What help will I get throughout the onboarding process?** Once you submit a request to participate in the Task Force, during the onboarding process participants are supported by the CNTT onboarding team members: indicated in your “Getting Started” email. Onboarding participants are welcomed to reach out for assistance any time during the onboarding process.
  
  - **What happens once I get onboarded?** Once you have reviewed the CNTT onboarding information and have agreed to the perquisite terms and agreements associated with participating and contributing to the Task Force, and you have completed onboarding and now it will be your opportunity to join desired work streams. For an initial period after onboarding, you will be assigned a volunteer mentor from the Task Force to help you get up to speed and contributing quickly.
