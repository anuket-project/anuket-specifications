## 2.1 Introduction

As an open-source community organization, Anuket CNTT has developed the following process to ensure delivery on the Anuket CNTT objectives. This process has several goals. First, to inform new participants about the background and overview of this open-source initiative. Second, to communicate the organizational and legal structures under which the community operates. And third, to help new participants to quickly become fully engaged in the Anuket CNTT work and to be contributing effectively to the work streams they are interested in.

## 2.2 Request Onboarding Info Packet

[Sample Welcome Message Here] 
Welcome to the Anuket CNTT group –

It is wonderful that you, [Company and person] have decided to join in the effort to make building the infrastructure to support Telecom workloads more robust and standardized. We believe that these efforts will benefit not only the operators, but also the vendors, and ultimately all our customers as well, by hopefully making it easier and simpler to incorporate new technology into our systems.

To get you started, I encourage you to go to our Getting Started page to download a packet of information on how to get engaged at the working level with Anuket CNTT.  We also have materials in the Wiki and Github repositories, so I hope that all this doesn’t overwhelm you.  We are excited that you have decided to become engaged with our community and look forward to your active participation.  

In addition to the many on-line work streams and workstream related on-line meetings, we also have periodic face to face workshops, which we find are invaluable for speeding the delivery of Anuket CNTT’s desired outcomes. More details on upcoming events can be found on the Anuket CNTT wiki. 

Feel free to reach out at any time, I am sure we will be more than happy to answer any questions you might have. Welcome again and looking forward to working with you.
