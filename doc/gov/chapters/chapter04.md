## 4.1 Introduction

The Anuket CNTT is structured into Workstreams so it can scale and accommodate participation from the wider community. The Anuket CNTT is open to participation by any individual or organization that agrees to comply with its Term of Reference ([ToR](../../../GSMA_Anuket CNTT_Terms_of_Reference.pdf)) (each such participant, a “Participant”). Each of the Workstreams within Anuket CNTT has one Lead and up to two Co-Leads. Leads and Co-Leads for each Workstream are selected by the community itself through a nomination and voting process. This document explains the Anuket CNTT policies and process regarding nomination and selection.

## 4.2 Workstreams Lead/Co-Lead Nomination and Selection

### 4.2.1 Length of Terms

The length of term for all Anuket CNTT leadership roles is **12** calendar months. It will start typically in February each year and end around the same time the year after.  The exact dates and timing might vary to accommodate Anuket CNTT releases and workshops.

### 4.2.2 Representation

Any Workstream Leads or Co-Leads positions can be held by any Participant.

<a name="4.2.3"></a>
### 4.2.3 Nomination

<a name="4.2.4"></a>
### 4.2.4 Selection

The process of nomination and selection is owned and managed by Anuket CNTT with help from LFN staff.

There will be a nomination window (typically around February each year) during which individuals can nominate others or nominate themselves for a position. The exact start and end date of the nomination window will be determined by Technical or Governance Committee Leads(depending on the nature of the Workstream).

During the nomination period, Participants can send their nominations to a designated individual who will help in administering the process (from Anuket CNTT Governance team or LFN Staff). The details and email addresses of that individual will be confirmed at the begining of the process.

Once the nomination period ends, the selection process for the new leads and co-leads for a given workstream is as follows:

- The selection process for Lead positions and Co-Lead positions will occur separately.
- No voting is required if the number of nominations received for a particular position is less than or equal to the number of available vacancies. 
- An online voting process will take place to select candidate(s) from the nominee list for each position.
  - The exact tool used for voting will be determined by the LFN Staff and depends on the approved tool at time of voting.
- Only Voting representatives can vote (from the up to date voting representative list).
- The candidate(s) who receives the highest number of votes win.
