## 4.1 Introduction

The CNTT is structured into Workstreams so it can scale and accommodate participation from the wider community. The CNTT is open to participation by any individual or organization that agrees to comply with its Term of Reference ([ToR](../../../GSMA_CNTT_Terms_of_Reference.pdf)) (each such participant, a “Participant”). Each of the Workstreams within CNTT has one Lead and up to two Co-Leads. Leads and Co-Leads for each Workstream are selected by the community itself through nomination and voting processes. This document explains the CNTT policies and process regarding nomination and selection.

### 4.2.1 Length of Terms

The length of term for all CNTT leadership roles is **12** calender months. It will start typically in February each year and end around the same time the year after. (Exact dates and timing might vary to accomodate CNTT releases and F2F workshops).

<a name="4.2.3"></a>
### 4.2.3 Nomination

### 4.2.4 Selection

The process of nomination and selection is owned and operated by CNTT with the help from LFN staff.

There will be a nomination window (typically around February each year) during which individuals can nominate others or nominate themselves for a position. The exact start and end date of the nomination window will be determined by Technical or Governance Committee Leads(depending on the nature of the Workstream).

During the nomination period, Participants can send their nominations to a designated individual who will help in administering the process (from CNTT Governance team or LFN Staff) . The details and email addresses of that individual will be clarified when the process is started.

Once the nomination period expires for a particular Workstream, the selection process will start as follows:

- Selection process for Leads positions and Co-Leads will occur separately.
- No voting will be required if number of nominations received for a particular position is less than or equal to the number of available vacancies. 
- Online Voting process will take place to select candidate(s) from the nominee list for any given position.
  - The exact tool used for voting will be determined by the LFN Staff who will help in administering the process and will depends on the approved tool at that point of time.
- Only Voting representatives can vote (from the up to date voting representative list).
- Candidate(s) who receives the highest number of votes win.
