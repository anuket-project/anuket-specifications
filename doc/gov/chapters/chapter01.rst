History of Anuket reference specifications
------------------------------------------

The Cloud iNfrastructure Telco Task Force (CNTT) was founded by AT&T, Vodafone, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, and
China Mobile. Soon thereafter, additional telco operator and vendor partner participants began to join the Task Force.
CNTT reached its first major milestone when it gained sponsorship and support of the GSMA and Linux Foundation
Networking in Summer 2019. As of June 2020, there were over thirty operators and partners (VNF suppliers, third-party
integrators, hw/sw suppliers) in its member community and these numbers have continued to grow. CNTT was collaborating
very closely with OPNFV and there were dependencies and overlap between the work of the two communities. In the
beginning of 2021 CNTT and OPNFV merged under the name `Anuket <https://anuket.io/>`__ to leverage the synergies between
the two projects.

The Anuket project community is leading the industry in creating a common infrastructure reference platform in the form
of reference model and reference architecture definitions to better support virtualised and containerised Network
Functions for the Telecom industry as a whole. The Anuket community includes many open source development projects to
create and support reference implementations, and develop tests for reference certification platforms.

The Anuket project operates under a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and governing rules documented in the `Anuket
Charter <https://anuket.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2021/07/Anuket-Charter_073021.pdf>`__ and in the Anuket Project
Operations and Guidelines document.
