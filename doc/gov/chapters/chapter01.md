## 1.1 History of Anuket reference specifications

The Cloud iNfrastructure Telco Task Force (CNTT) was founded by AT&T, Vodafone, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, and China Mobile. Soon thereafter, additional telco operator and vendor partner participants began to join the Task Force. CNTT reached its first major milestone when it gained sponsorship and support of the GSMA and Linux Foundation Networking in Summer 2019. As of June 2020, there were over thirty operators and partners (VNF suppliers, third-party integrators, hw/sw suppliers) in its member community and these numbers have continued to grow. CNTT was collaborating very closely with OPNFV and there were dependencies and overlap between the work of the two communities. In the beginning of 2021 CNTT and OPNFV merged under the name [Anuket](https://anuket.io/) to leverage the synergies between the two projects.

The Anuket project community is leading the industry in creating a common infrastructure reference platform in the form of reference model and reference architecture definitions to better support virtualised and containerised Network Functions for the Telecom industry as a whole. The Anuket community is collaborating with other open source communities to operationalize and support reference implementations and reference certification platforms. 

The Anuket project operates under a Technical Oversight Committee (TSC) and governing rules documented in the [Anuket Charter](https://anuket.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/119/2021/07/Anuket-Charter_073021.pdf) and in the Anuket Project Operations and Guidelines document.
