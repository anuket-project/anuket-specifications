## 3.4 New Work Streams Policy
In order for CNTT to stay current with new trends in the industry and the introduction of new technologies and processes, there will be scenarios where a new WS for a new specification work is needed to be created within CNTT. Following is CNTT policy of creating a new WS:

- A new Work Stream **Proposal** has to be created and should contain the following information:
  - The nature of the Work Stream proposed (Architecture, Implementation, Certification, else).
  - Detailed scope of the proposed Work Stream.
  - The rationale behind the need for a new Work Stream instead of making it part of an existing Work Stream.
  - The relationship to other Work Streams.
  - The impact on other Work Streams.
  - The relationship to open-source communities and standard setting organisations (if any).
  - Proposed Roadmap.
  - List of committed contributors (at least five) and committed named Work stream Leads and Co-Leads.
  - Endorsement from at least 2 service providers and 2 vendors.
- New Work Stream proposals need to be approved by the Technical Steering Committee during their regular meetings.
- New Work Stream proposals need to be approved and signed off by Governance Steering Committee during their regular meetings.
