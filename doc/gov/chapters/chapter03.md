## 3.4 New Work Streams Policy
One of Anuket CNTT's core principals is to stay current with new and emerging trends in the industry, including how to integrate new technologies and processes. As things change over time, there will be the need to create new Work Streams within the Anuket CNTT organizational framework. The following is the Anuket CNTT policy for creating a new Work Stream:

- The first step is to create a new Work Stream **Proposal**.  It should contain the following information:
  - The nature of the Work Stream proposed (Architecture, Implementation, Certification, else).
  - A detailed scope of the proposed Work Stream.
  - The rationale behind the need for a new Work Stream, rather than including it in an existing Work Stream.
  - The relationship to other Work Streams.
  - The impact of the new Work Steam on the other Work Streams.
  - The relationship to other open-source communities and standards setting organisations (if any).
  - Proposed Roadmap.
  - A list of committed contributors (at least five) and committed named Work stream Leads and Co-Leads.
  - Endorsement from at least 2 service providers and 2 vendors.
- New Work Stream proposals need to be approved by the Technical Steering Committee during their regular meetings.
- New Work Stream proposals need to be approved and signed off by Governance Steering Committee during their regular meetings.
