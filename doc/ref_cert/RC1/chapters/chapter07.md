As detailed in the CNTT RC chapter 05 on E2E VNF test platform requirements,
ONAP VNF Test Platform (VTP) helps to perform the VNF Conformance process by
addressing those requirements. And following sections provides required
guidelines and details for platform and test cases.

### 7.3.1 Platform Architecture

Provides details on the architecture, components and it's responsibilities.

-   **Test Controller**: For every feature supported in VTP, Test controller
    provides required REST API along with user authentication and authorization
    based on given tenant?.

-   **Agile Test Orchestrator**: Dynamically allows to on-board and execute the
    test cases and test flows across different run-time environment on given
    System under test (SUT) along with required supported system in place.

-   **Portal & CLI**: To operate and manage the VTP features, Portal? provides
    web 2.0 based graphical user interface along with Command line interface.

-   **Test case plug-ins**: Test cases are on-boarded into the system as
    independent plug-ins (developed using different programming/scripting
    language) and/or plain text yaml file for those supported as profile in VTP
    (such as HTTP, SNMP, etc)

-   **Repository**: Provides version controlled repository for persisting
    various aspects of the VTP such as artifacts, results, reports, etc.

### 7.3.2 Platform administrator guide

Provides detail on installation, configuration, un-installation operations.

VTP is provided a script for performing installation and mange the installed VTP
services as below:

[vpt_install.sh](https://github.com/onap/vnfsdk-refrepo/blob/master/vnfmarket-be/deployment/install/vtp_install.sh)

**--download** : It will download all required artifacts into /opt/vtp_stage

**--install** : It will install VTP (/opt/controller) and CLI (/opt/oclip)

**--start** : It will start VTP controller as tomcat service and CLI as oclip
service

**--verify** : It will verify the setup is done properly by running some test
cases

**--uninstall** : It will stop and uninstall the VTP

**--clean** : It will remove the downloaded artifacts
