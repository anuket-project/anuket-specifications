# CNTT Reference Conformance (RC) Test Case Integration

All CNTT conformance suites must fulfill the following test case integration
requirements to guarantee a smooth overall integration, the same end user
actions and a unique test result format (e.g. OPNFV test result database)
needed by the end users and the test case result verification programs (e.g.
[OVP](https://www.opnfv.org/verification)). Historically, these rules were
agreed by RC1 team and have been applied since
[CNTT Snezka](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/wiki/Snezka). The new RC2 stream
asks to move them in this common place applicable to all CNTT conformance
suites.

## CNTT RI and RC toolchains

[OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org/) has built a complete CI/CD toolchain
for continuously deploying and testing cloud infrastructure.

As for all OPNFV installer projects,
[Jenkins](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/cntt/) triggers scenario deployments,
runs the OPNFV gating test cases and then publishes all test results in the
[centralized test database](https://docs.opnfv.org/en/stable-hunter/_images/OPNFV_testing_working_group.png)
and all artifacts (reports, logs, etc.) to
[an S3 compatible storage service](http://artifacts.opnfv.org/).

The CNTT verification, validation, and conformance processes leverage
existing OPNFV testing knowledge (projects) and experience (history) and then
conform to the overall toolchain design already in-place. The RC toolchain
only requires for the local deployment of the components instead of leveraging
the common OPNFV centralized services. But the interfaces remain unchanged
mainly leveraging test jobs, the common test case execution, the test
result database and the S3 protocol to publish the artifacts. It's worth
mentioning that dumping all results and logs required for conformance is
already in place in CIRV (see
[cntt-latest-zip](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/job/cntt-latest-zip/)) and
Functest daily jobs (see
[functest-hunter-zip](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/job/functest-hunter-zip/3/console)).

It should be noted that
[Xtesting CI](https://galaxy.ansible.com/collivier/xtesting) supports both
centralized and distributed deployment models as described before. It has
deployed the full toolchain in one small virtual machine to verify ONAP Openlab
via Functest.

## Test case integration requirements

To reach all goals (verification, validation, compliance, and conformance)
expected by CNTT, all test cases must be delivered as
[Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/) and meet the requirements to
simplify the CI toolchain setups:
- the common test case execution
- the unified way to manage all the interactions with the CI/CD components and
  with third-parties (e.g. dump all test case logs and results for
  conformance)

For their part, the Docker containers simply enforce that the test cases are
delivered with all runtime dependencies. This prevents lots of manual
operations when configuring the servers running the test cases and prevents
conflicts between the test cases due to any dependencies.

It's worth mentioning that current
[test cases selected by CNTT](./chapter03.md)
already leverage [Xtesting](https://xtesting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
which is a simple framework to assemble sparse test cases and to accelerate the
adoption of CI/CD best practices. By managing all the interactions with the
CI/CD components (test scheduler, test results database, artifact repository),
it allows the developer to work only on the test suites without diving into
CI/CD integration. Even more, it brings the capability to run heterogeneous
test cases in the same CI toolchains thanks to a few,
[quickly achievable](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/opnfvs-6th-release-brings-testing-capabilities-that-orange-is-already-using/2018/05/),
constraints.

The Docker containers proposed by the test projects must also embed
[the Xtesting Python package](https://pypi.org/project/xtesting/) and
[the related test case execution description files](https://git.opnfv.org/functest-xtesting/tree/docker/testcases.yaml)
as required by Xtesting.

projects:

## Testing Cookbooks

[Xtesting CI](https://galaxy.ansible.com/collivier/xtesting) leverages the
common test case execution proposed by Xtesting. Thanks to a simple test case
list, this tool deploys plug-and-play
[CI/CD toolchains in a few commands](https://wiki.opnfv.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=32015004).
In addition, it supports multiple components such as Jenkins and Gitlab CI
(test schedulers) and
[multiple deployment models](https://lists.opnfv.org/g/opnfv-tsc/message/5702)
such as all-in-one or centralized services.

[Xtesting](https://xtesting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[Xtesting CI](https://galaxy.ansible.com/collivier/xtesting) combined meet the
CNTT requirements about verification, validation, compliance, and conformance:
- smoothly assemble multiple heterogeneous test cases
- generate the Jenkins jobs in
  [OPNFV Releng](https://git.opnfv.org/releng/tree/jjb/airship/cntt.yaml) to
  verify CNTT RI
- deploy local CI/CD toolchains everywhere to check compliance with CNTT
- [dump all test case results and logs](http://artifacts.opnfv.org/functest/9ID39XK47PMZ.zip)
  for third-party conformance review

Here are a couple of publicly available playbooks :
- [Xtesting samples](https://git.opnfv.org/functest-xtesting/plain/ansible/site.yml?h=stable/kali)
- [OpenStack verification](https://git.opnfv.org/functest/plain/ansible/site.yml?h=stable/kali)
- [CNTT RC1](https://git.opnfv.org/functest/plain/ansible/site.cntt.yml?h=stable/hunter)
- [Kubernetes verification](https://git.opnfv.org/functest-kubernetes/plain/ansible/site.yml?h=stable/kali)

[Xtesting CI](https://galaxy.ansible.com/collivier/xtesting) only requires
GNU/Linux as Operating System and asks for a few dependencies as described in
[Deploy your own Xtesting CI/CD toolchains](https://wiki.opnfv.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=32015004):
- python-virtualenv
- docker.io
- git

Please note the next two points depending on the GNU/Linux distributions and
the network settings:
- SELinux: you may have to add -\-system-site-packages when creating the
  virtualenv ("Aborting, target uses selinux but python bindings
  (libselinux-python) aren't installed!")
- Proxy: you may set your proxy in env for Ansible and in systemd for Docker
  https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy
