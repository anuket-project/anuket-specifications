## 1.2 Scope

This document covers the realisation aspects of Verification and Certification of both NFVI and VNFs. The document will cover the following topics:

- Identify in details the Requirements for Verification and Certification Framework.
- Identify in details the Requirement of Test Cases (and mapping them to requirements from The Reference Model and The OpenStack Based Reference Architecture ).
- analysis of existing community projects.
- Propose an E2E Framework for verification and certification of NFVI and VNFs.
- Playbook of instructions, user manuals, steps of how to perform verification and certification for both NFVI and VNFs using hte proposed E2E Framework.
- Gap analysis to identify where the Gaps are in the industry (tooling, test cases, process, etc).
- Identify development efforts needed to address any gaps identified.
