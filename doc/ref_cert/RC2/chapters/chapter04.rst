CNF Test Cases and Requirements Traceability
============================================

Introduction
------------

The scope of this chapter is to identify and list test cases based on
requirements defined in :doc:`ref_arch_kubernetes:index`.
This will serve as traceability between test cases and requirements for
Kubernetes platform interoperability.

Note that each requirement may have one or more test cases associated
with it.

The Anuket Assured Workload badge requires that workloads are expected
to return **Must/Must Not** results all of the tests/suites identified
as priority (see table).

Selection Criteria
------------------

Test cases, tools and their dependencies must be open source. The test
cases (or test suite with the test case) as well as the environment
needed to run the test should be reproducible by any party following
publicly available documentation.

Examples of initiatives (having testing tools, test suites, etc) with
test cases which could be used include K8s Conformance, K8s e2e,
Sonobuoy, Anuket Functest, CNF Conformance.

Traceability Matrix
-------------------

The following is a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) mapping Test
Case, and/or Test Case Coverage, to RM and RA requirements â€“
configuration, deployment, runtime.

Test Case Traceability to RA2 Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section focuses on the test cases covering the requirements in
:ref:`ref_arch_kubernetes:chapters/chapter04:kubernetes workloads`
for Kubernetes workloads.

   * - RM/RA Ref
     - High-level test definition
     - Test name and project
     - Priority
   * - ra2.app.006
     - Consumption of additional, non-default connection points.
       Any additional non-default connection points must be requested
       through the use of workload annotations
       or resource requests and limits within the container spec passed to the
       Kubernetes API Server.
     - :ref:`int.api.01 <chapters/chapter02:Kubernetes Architecture Requirements>`
     - Must
   * - ra2.app.007
     - Workloads must not use `hostPath volumes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath>`__, as
       Pods with identical configuration (such as those created from a PodTemplate) may behave differently on different
       nodes due to different files on the nodes.

     - Must
   * - ra2.app.008
     - Infrastructure dependency
     - Workloads **must not** rely on the availability of the master nodes for
       the successful execution of their functionality (i.e. loss of the
       master nodes may affect non-functional behaviours such as healing and
       scaling, but components that are already running will continue to do so
       without issue).
     - Must (Not)
   * - ra2.app.009
     - Device plugins
     - Workload descriptors must use the resources advertised by the device
       plugins to indicate their need for an FPGA, SR-IOV or other
       acceleration device.
     - Must
   * - ra2.app.010
     - Node Feature Discovery (NFD)
