## Executive Summary

The RC2 was established to ensure implementations of the CNTT Reference Architecture 2 (RA2), such as the Reference Implementation 2 (RI2), meet functional and performance requirements derived from RA2 and the CNTT Reference Model (RM). For the purpose of this chapter, cloud infrastructure and cloud native network function (CNF) testing will be specified to evaluate **Conformance** (i.e. adherence) to, and demonstrated proficiency with, all aspects of hardware and software delivery that is within the scope of CNTT. Conformance scope includes:

 - Test criteria with requirements tracebility ensuring implementations of cloud infrastructure match expected capabilites exemplified by CNTT Reference Implementations and CNFs match match expected capabilites for consuming compliant cloud infrastructure resources
 - Guidelines for conformance testing evaluation criteria used for CNTT related infrastructure badging programs
 - Guidelines for conformance testing environments and tools for enabling infrastructure vendor or 3rd party conformance testing

In summary, **Conformance** testing will be performed as part of cloud infrastructure and CNF lifecycle testing which includes **Verification** and **Validation**, defined further as:

- **Verification** confirms design requirement specifications are met using Requirement Traceability and Manifest Reviews to ensure the cloud infrastructure or CNF is delivered per implementation specifications.
- **Validation** confirms the infrastructure or CNF meet the expected or desired behaviour.

**All Terms utilized throughout this chapter are intended to align with LFN Complinace and Verification Committee (CVC) definitions, and their use through CVC documentation, guidelines, and standards.**

## 1.1 Introduction

**Chapter Purpose**<br>
This chapter includes process flow, logistics, and requirements which must be satisfied to ensure Kubernetes infrastructure meets the design, feature, and capability expectations of the Reference Model (RM) and RA2. Ultimately, RC2 will reduce the amount of time and cost it takes each operator to on-board and maintain cloud infrastructure and CNFs.

**Objective**<br>
Specify Kubernetes infrastructure and CNF Conformance aspects using requirements in CNTT RA2 and RM.

Upstream projects define features/capabilities, test scenarios, and test cases which may be used for infrastructure and/or CNF verification and validation. Where feasible existing test frameworks, test methods and tests may also be used be used for conformance testing along with new tests developed where there are gaps.  

Many existing tests currently being considered for RC-2 are functional tests from upstream projects. Reuse of existing test suites is encouraged however OVP 2.0 is not aiming to replace programs such as Certified Kubernetes which is a "CNCF software conformance program that ensures a vendor’s version of Kubernetes supports the required APIs, as do open source community version". 

The focus of conformance is to test the actual behavior of the system with respect to a capability specified in the RM or RA-2. 


**Test Methodology**
- Verification test to make sure that the Kubernetes services have been deployed and configured correctly
- Manifest Verifications (Termed Compliance by CVC) will ensure the infrastructure is compliant, and delivered for testing, with hardware and software profile specifications defined by the RM and RA2
- Candidate CNF Validation will ensure interoperablity of CNF behaviour on the Kubernetes infrastructure.  Testing ensures CNFs can be spun up, modified, or removed, on the target infrastructure (aka Interoperability).

### 1.1.1 Terminology

Terminology in this document will follow [CNTT Terminology](../../../tech/glossary.md). Relevant testing terminology includes:

<a name="1.2"></a>
## 1.2 Scope

This document covers aspects of CNTT conformance for both Kubernetes based cloud infrastructure and CNFs. The document will cover the following topics:

- Identify in details the requirements of test-cases (mapped from RA2 and RM)
- Test criteria that shows a certain capability or feature of the system-under-test exists and behaves as expected
- An E2E framework for conformance of Kubernetes infrastructures and CNFs, including specification for conformance test infrastructure (lab environment and tools)
- Analysis to identify where the gaps are in the industry for implementing conformance test objectives (tooling, methods, process, etc).

**Not in Scope**
- Functional testing / validation of the application provided by the CNF is outside the scope of this work.
- Testing to confirm specific versions of APIs or software components is out of scope of conformance since this is an unambiguous part of a product specification.
- ONAP is not used in the process flow for infrastructure verifications, or validations.
- Upgrades to CNFs, and the respective processes of verifying upgrade procedures and validating (testing) the success and compatibility of upgrades is not in scope.

## 1.3 Principles and Guidelines

The objectives of the Reference Conformance for cloud infrastrucute is to verify implementations against the reference architecture which satisfies infrastructure needs for CNFs.

The objectives of the Reference Conformance for CNFs is to verify CNF implementations consume resources and behave as expected against the reference architecture.

These core principles will guide RC2 deliverables:

- RC-2 requirements are derived from RM and RA-2 which specify infrastructure capabilities which include compute, memory, storage resource capabilities, performance optimization capabilities, monitoring capabilities.

- Requirements in the RM and RAs that are performance related may not have minimum perfromance criteria identified but where feasible will have tests with metrics to show relevant capabilities are present and working as expected.

- Must/shall conformance criteria are testable as pass/fail and ensure requirement are met to ensure minimum thresholds of functional operability and/or performance behavior. This is the focus of RC-2 since this is what will drive a commercially significant badging program.

- Should/may conformance criteria may be testable or non-testable and provide recommendations or best-practices for functional operability and/or performance behavior. These criteria and associated tests can be very useful for developing, evaluating or deploying a cloud infrastructure but are not critical to a commercially significant badging program.

### 1.3.1 Overarching Standards and Goals

1. Test Harnesses will be portable, or compatible, across all RAs/Distributions which already conform to standard interfaces and services.
2. Increase probability of CNFs.
3. Decrease operator onboarding time for both Kubernetes infrastructures and CNFs.

<a name="1.4"></a>
## 1.4 Best Practices

The following best practices have been adopted to ensure verification and validation procedures are repeatable with consistent quality in test results and RI conformances:

* Standardized test methodology / flow, Test Plan, and Test Case Suites
* Integration with upstream projects and flow (code, docs, cert criteria, etc.)
* Leverage Network and Service Models, with identified CNF-specific parameters
* Standardized conformance criteria
* Add test cases from operators, which operators already tested in their environment

<a name="1.5"></a>
## 1.5 Verification methodologies

Perform CNF interoperability verifications against an implementation of CNTT RA2. Upstream projects will define features/capabilities, test scenarios, and test cases to be executed via the OVP Ecosystem.

3rd Party test platforms may also be leveraged, if desired.

<a name="1.6"></a>
## 1.6 Assumptions & Dependencies

**Assumptions** Infrastructure and CNF testing will be considered **Testable** if the follow
qualifiers are present in a test execution, and subsequent result:
* Ability to perform Conformance, or Verification of Artifacts to ensure
  designs (RM/RA/RI) are delivered per specification
* Ability to Control (or manipulate), manifestations of RM/RA/RI for the
  purposes to adjust the test environment, and respective cases, scenarios, and
  apparatus, to support actual test validations
* Ability to monitor, measure, and report, Validations performed against a
  target, controlled system under test

In addition, respective Entrance criteria is a prerequisite which needs to be
satisfied for infrastructure and CNFs to be considered **Testable**.

**Dependencies** infrastructure and CNFs verification will rely upon test harnesses, test
tools, and test suites provided by upstream projects, including OPNFV and CNF conformance. 
These upstream projects will be reviewed
semi-annually to verify they are still healthy and active projects. Over time,
the projects representing the conformance process may change, but test parity
is required if new test suites are added in place of older, stale projects.

* infrastructure and CNF verifications will be performed against well defined instance types
  consisting of a HW and SW Profile, Configured Options, and Applied Extensions
  (See image.)

**Infrastructure Instance Type:**
* Standard compute flavours to be tested are defined in RM
  [chapter 4.2.1](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/master/doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter04.md#4.2.1)
* Performance profiles come in the form of Basic and Network Intensive. Refer to RM
