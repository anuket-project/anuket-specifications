Reference Conformance for RA2 based Implementations (RC2)
=========================================================

Reference conformance specification (RC2) for RA2-based
implementations is discontinued. 
Anuket TSC sadly decided to terminate RC2 in its 2023.08.08 meeting
(https://wiki.anuket.io/display/HOME/2023-08-08+TSC+Agenda+and+Minutes).

The last maintained version of RC2 can be found in the stable/orinoco branch.
