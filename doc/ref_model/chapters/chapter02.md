The Cloud Infrastructure is the totality of all hardware and software components which build up the environment in which VNFs/CNFs (workloads) are deployed, managed and executed. It is, therefore, inevitable that different workloads would require different capabilities and have different expectations from it.

One of the main targets of the CNTT is to define an agnostic cloud infrastructure, to remove any dependencies between workloads and the deployed cloud infrastructure, and offer infrastructure resources to workloads in an abstracted way with defined capabilities and metrics.

This means, operators will be able to host their Telco workloads (VNFs/CNFs) with different traffic types, behaviour and from any vendor on a unified consistent cloud infrastructure.

Additionally, a well defined cloud infrastructure is also needed for other type of workloads such as IT, Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.

In this chapter we try to analyse various workload types used in telco and examine their requirements. We will also highlight some of the cloud infrastructure parameters needed to achieve the desired performance expected by various workloads.

# 2.1 Workloads Collateral

There are different ways that workloads can be classified, for example:
- **By function type:**
  - Data Plane (a.k.a., User Plane, Media Plane, Forwarding Plane)
  - Control Plane (a.k.a, Signalling Plane)
  - Management Plane
  >_**Note**: Data plane workloads also include control and management plane functions ; control plane workloads also include management plane functions._
- **By service offered:**
  - Mobile broadband service
  - Fixed broadband Service
  - Voice Service
  - Value-Added-Services
- **By technology:** 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, IMS, FTTx, Wi-Fi...

# 2.2 Analysis

Studying various requirements of workloads helps understanding what expectation they will have from the underlying cloud infrastructure. Following are _some_ of the requirement types on which various workloads might have different expectation levels:

- **Computing**
  - Speed (e.g., CPU clock and physical cores number)
  - Predictability (e.g., CPU and RAM sharing level)
  - Specific processing (e.g., cryptography, transcoding)
- **Networking**
  - Throughput (i.e., bit rate and/or packet rate)
  - Latency
  - Connection points / interfaces number (i.e., vNIC and VLAN)
  - Specific traffic control (e.g., firewalling, NAT, cyphering)
  - Specific external network connectivity (e.g., MPLS, VXLAN)
- **Storage**
  - IOPS (i.e., input/output rate and/or byte rate)
  - Volume
  - Ephemeral or Persistent
  - Specific features (e.g., object storage, local storage)

By trying to sort workloads into different categories based on the requirements observed, below are the different profiles concluded, which are mainly driven by expected performance levels:

- **Profile One**
  - Workload types
    - Control plane functions without specific need, and management plane functions
    - _Examples: OFCS, AAA, NMS_
  - No specific requirement
- **Profile Two**
  - Workload types
    - Data plane functions (i.e., functions with specific networking and computing needs)
    - _Examples: BNG, S/PGW, UPF, Sec-GW, DPI, CDN, SBC, MME, AMF, IMS-CSCF, UDR_
  - Requirements
    - Predictable computing
    - High network throughput
    - Low network latency
<!--
- **Profile Three**
  - Workload types
    - Control plane functions with specific computing needs
    - _Examples: MME, AMF, IMS-CSCF_
  - Requirements
    - Predictable computing
    - Low network latency    

- **Profile Four**
  - Workload types
    - Control plane functions with specific storage needs
    - _Example: UDR_
  - Requirements
    - High storage IOPS
    - High storage volume

# 2.3 Cloud Infrastructure Profiles

Based on the above analysis, following cloud infrastructure profiles are proposed (also shown in **Figure 2-1** below)
- **Basic**: for VNFCs that can tolerate resource over-subscription and variable latency.
- **Network Intensive**: for VNFCs that require predictable computing performance, high network throughput and low network latency.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch02_infra_profiles.PNG" alt="infra_profiles" title="Infrastructure Profiles" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 2-1:</b> Infrastructure profiles proposed based on VNFs categorisation.</p>

On **Chapter 4** later in the document, these infrastructure profiles will be offered to workloads: **B (Basic)** and **N (Network intensive)** <!--, and **C (Compute intensive)** --> respectively.

>***Note**  
>This is an initial set of proposed profiles and it is expected that more profiles will be added as more requirements are gathered and as technology enhances and matures. For instance, the following profiles may be added in future releases:*
>- **Compute Intensive**: for VNFCs that require predictable computing performance and low network latency.
>- ***Storage Intensive**: for VNFCs that require low storage latency and/or high storage IOPS.*
>- ***Enhanced Compute Intensive**: for compute intensive VNFCs that require higher computing performance and/or specific compute resource (e.g., GPU).*
>- ***Enhanced Network Intensive**: for network intensive VNFCs that require higher network performance and/or specific network resource (e.g., crypto acceleration).*
