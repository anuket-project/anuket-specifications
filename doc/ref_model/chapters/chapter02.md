The NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) is the totality of all hardware and software components which build up the environment in which VNFs/VAs are deployed, managed and executed. It is, therefore, inevitable that different VNFs/VAs would require different capabilities and have different expectations from it.

One of the main targets of the CNTT is to define an agnostic NFVI and removes any dependencies between VNFs/VAs and the deployed Infrastructure (NFVI) and offer NFVI to VNFs/VAs in an abstracted way with defined capabilities and metrics.

This means, operators will be able to host their Telco Workload (VNF) with different traffic types, behaviour and from any vendor on a unified consistent Infrastructure.

Additionally, a well defined NFVI is also needed for other type of workloads than NFV such as IT, Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc. 

In this chapter we try to analyse various VNF types used in telco and examine their requirements. We will also highlight some of the NFVI parameters needed to achieve the desired performance expected by various workloads.

# 2.1 VNFs collateral

There are many ways that VNFs can be classified, for example: 

- **By Traffic Type:** 
    - User Plane (Data Plane)
    - Control Plane (Signalling Plane).  
    - Management Plane.
-	**By Service offered:**
    - Mobile broadband service: vEPC, vDPI, vGI-FW 
    - Fixed broadband Service vBNG, vDPI
    - VoLTE / VoWifi : vIMS , UDC , HSBC , vEPDG. 
    - VASs : vSMS-C ,  vCDN , vCGNAT 
-	**By Technology:** (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, Fixed...)  

Below is a list of Network Functions that covers almost _**95%**_ of the Telco workload (and the most likely to be virtualized/moved to cloud). They don't follow any specific categorisation.

# 2.2 Analysis

Studying various requirements of VNFs helps understanding what expectation they will have from the underlying NFVI. Following are _some_ of the requirement you might expect by various workloads:

- Number of VNFC
- Networking between VNFC
- Enhanced Platform awareness (EPA)
  - CPU Pinning 
  - SR-IOV
  - Affinity / Anti-affinity rules
  - Huge Pages 
  - NUMA alignment
  - DPDK
- Hyper-Threading/SMT
-	Packet per Second
-	User Space 
- Security
  - Advanced Encryption Standard – New Instructions (Intel® AES – NI).
  - SELinux 
- Storage requirements  
  - Ephemeral or Persistence.
  - Number of IOPS required 
  - Volume 

By trying to categorise VNF components into different categories based on the requirement observed, below are the different profiles concluded:

- **Profile One -** Signalling / Control traffic profile/ Management OSS/BSS and Non-Telco workload:  
  -	Low throughput
  -	A small number of Network cards
  - Low PPS 
  - EPA enabled (in some cases)
  - _**Example:**  (PCRF, IMS, NMS)_

- **Profile Two -** Network Intensive Workloads:
  - High throughput
  - Multiple Network Interfaces.
  - High PPS 
  - EPA enabled 
  - _**Example:** BNG,  CDN, EPC_

- **Profile Three -** Compute Intensive Workloads:
  - Algorithmic Intensive
  - GPU.
  - Smart NIC / FPGA
  - _**Example:** SEC-GW, Firewall, DPI_

- **Profile Four -** Storage Intensive Workloads:
  -	Hight IOPS 
  -	Hight capacity
  -	EPA enabled 
  - _**Example:** UDR_

# 2.3 NFVI Profiles

Based on the above analysis, following NFVI profiles are proposed (Also shown in **Figure 2-1** below)

- **Basic**: VNFs with VNF-Cs that perform basic compute operations. 
- **Network intensive**: VNFs with VNF-Cs that perform network intensive operations with high throughput and low latency requirements.
- **Compute Intensive**: VNFs with VNF-Cs that perform compute intensive operations with low latency requirements.
- **Storage Intensive**: VNFs with VNF-Cs that perform storage intensive operations with high IPOS requirements. (_**Note:** Storage Intensive Profile will not be defined in initial CNTT releases_)

>_**Note**: 	This is an initial set of proposed profiles and it is expected that more profiles will be added as more requirements are gathered and as technology enhances and matures._

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2-1:</b> Infrastructure profiles proposed based on VNFs categorisation.</p>

On **Chapter 4** later in the document, those infrastructure profiles will be offered to VNFs in form of instance types: **B (Basic)**, **N (Network intensive)**, and **C (Compute intensive)** respectively.
