## Synopsis

Ensure Reference Implementation of CNTT Reference Model and CNTT Reference Architecture meets industry driven quality assurance standards for compliance, verification and validation.  The OPNFV Verified Program (OVP), by Linux Foundation Networking (LFN), in partnership with the Compliance Verification Committee (CVC), will provide tracking and governance for RM/RA verification.

For the purposes of this chapter, NFVI+VNF testing will be performed for **Verification** and **Validations** purpose.  **Certifications**, which are Out of Scope, include a measured performance of the adherence to, and demonstrated proficiency with, all aspects of software delivery including but no limited to planning, logistics for communication, and development of which there are no code developed/delivered with the NFVI+VNF testing and verification.

<a name="8.1"></a>
## 8.1 Introduction

**Objective**<br>
Perform NFVI+VNF Verification and Validations using CNTT reference architecture, leveraging the existing OPNFV and CVC Intake and Validation Process to onboard and validate new test projects for NFVI compliance.  Upstream projects will define features/capabilities, test scenarios, and test cases to augment existing OVP test harnesses to be executed via the OVP Ecosystem.

**Scope and Test Methodology**
- Manifest Verifications (aka CVC Compliance) will ensure the NFVI is compliant, and delivered for testing, with hardware and software profile specifications defined by the Ref Model and Ref Architecture.
- Empirical Validation with Reference Golden VNFs (aka CVC Validation) will ensure the NFVI runs with a set of VNF Families, or Classes, to minic production-like VNF connectivity, for the purposes of interopability checks.
- Candidate VNF Validation (Validation & Performance) will ensure complete interoperablity of VNF behaviour on the NFVI leverage VVP/VNFSDK test suites.  Testing ensures VNF can be spun up, modified, or removed, on the target NFVI (aka Interoperability).

**Different Distributions**
The three step methodolgy described above of verifying Manifest compliance, exeucting Empirical Golden VNF transactions, and performing Interopability Testing is the same validation proces regardless of the Distribution used to establish a cloud topology, and the components and serivces used in the client software stack.  


**Not in Scope**

- Functional testing/validation of the VNF is not in scope.
- ONAP is not used in the process flow for NFVI verifications, or validations.
- Upgrades to VNFs, and the respective processes of verifying upgrade procedures and validating (testing) the success and compatibility of upgrades is not in scope.

**Chapter Purpose**<br>
This chapter includes process flow, logistics, and requirements which must be satisfied to ensure Network Function Virtualisation Infrastructure (NFVI) meets the design, feature, and capability expectations of VNF developers promoting both the use and scalability of Software Defined Networking (SDN) capabilities.  Upstream projects will define features/capabilities, test scenarios, and test cases which will be used to augment OVP test harnesses for infrastructure verification purposes.  Existing processes, communication mediums, and related technologies will be utilized where feasible.  Ultimately, test results of certified NFVI+VNF will reduce the amount of time and cost it takes each operator to on-board and maintain vendor provided VNFs.

## 8.2 Principles and Guidelines

The objectives of the verification program are to deliver a validated implementation of reference architecture which satisfies infrastructure needs for VNF-developer teams, leveraging the OVP ecosystem as the vehicle for delivering validated NFVI.

These core principles will guide NFV verification deliverables:

<a name="8.2.1"></a>
### 8.2.1 Overarching Objectives and Goals

1. Deliver verified implementation of reference architecture which satisfies infrastructure needs for VNF-developer teams.
2. All accomplished with augmentation to the current OVP ecosystem.
3. Increase probability VNFs will on-board and function with minimal problems, or issues, during initial instantiation of VNF.
4. Test Harnesses will be portable, or compatible, across all RAs/Distributions which already conform to standard interfaces and services.

<a name="8.2.2"></a>
### 8.2.2 Verification Methodologies
<ol>
<li>Engineering package validations will be performed against targeted infrastructure/architecture.</li>
<li>Configuration settings/features/capabilities will be baseline</li>
<li>Entrance Criteria Guidelines will be satisfied prior to OPNFV verification (i.e. Supplier needs to submit/agree/conform)
<ol>
<li>Conform to CNTT ref model</li>
<li>Confirm to ref arch</li>
<li>Submit standard documentation</li>
<li>Adhere to security compliance</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Exit Criteria Guidelines will be satisfied prior to issuance of OPNFV compliance badges.
<ol>
<li>Certification for Tenants (OVP Ecosystem)</li>
<li>Operaitonal Considerations (Telco Perspective)</li>
<li>End User Considerations (Telco Perspective)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Test runs using reference model VNFs will validate RA chosen by the VNF-supplier meets developer needs</li>
<li>Verification decisions will be based on data. Test harness is &ldquo;compatible&rdquo;, or &ldquo;conforms&rdquo; to testing against standard interfaces and services</li>
<li>VNF functionality easily tested w/ addition of Supplier Apparatus</li>
<li>Leverage test harnesses from existing open source projects where practical, and applicable.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<a name="8.5.1"></a>
### 8.5.1 Process (CVC)

<p><u><strong>CVC Compliance, Verification, and Certification governing framework consists of: </strong></u>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance testing</strong>: compares the system under test against the specifications / standards</li>
<li><strong>Validation testing:</strong> ensures the system under test is operating according to its intended / required purpose</li>
<li><strong>Performance testing</strong>: measures how well the system under test performs its specific purpose(s)</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>OVP certifications are accomplished as a two-part process: </strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>OPNFV provides Test Tools and Test Cases to OVP.</li>
<li>OVP provides vendor NFVI products a &ldquo;badge&rdquo; claiming &ldquo;OPNFV-certified&rdquo; once OVP testing passes successfully (via Dovetail).</li>
</ol>

<a name="8.5.2"></a>
### 8.5.2 Process (OPNFV)

<p><strong>OPNFV Releases, and their repsective test verificaitons and validations requires 1) the implentation and adoption of an Installer to perform the needed installation and distirbution of infrastructure componetns and services, 2) identification and acceptance of a Feature Project introducing new, or enhanced, platform capabilities, and 3) an appropriate Test Project explicitly calling out the test use cases and scenarnios for verificaiton and validation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>More specifically:</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Release Status</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Installer oriented release. CNTT does not recommended any specific installer. An agnostic approach is taken that allows for an implementation to determine their own installer.</li>
<li>Multiple installers exist</li>
<li>Multiple scenarios exist, with one scenario represents a certain integration group and a certain configuration</li>
<li>All releases must pass CI（Continuous Integration) test</li>
<li>OVP includes test cases that at lease one OPNFV release scenario can pass</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Feature Projects</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Define a certain feature for the OPNFV release, e.g. high availability</li>
<li>Work with upstream projects to develop features</li>
<li>Work with testing projects to define and co-develop feature tests</li>
<li>Work with installer projects to develop certain scenarios including the feature</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Test scenarios</span> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Derived from Projects coming into OPNFV for release scoping, resulting in test cases used by OVP for verification and certification.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Only test cases that can let one of the scenarios pass can be included in OVP.</li>
<li>This is a procedure to make sure OVP test cases are written in a right way</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Future versions would require this to be the reference NFVI defined by CNTT</p>

## 8.6 CNTT/NFVI Compliance, Verification, and Certification Strategy

<a name="8.6.1"></a>
### 8.6.1 Methodology.

Perform VNF interoperability verifications against an implementation of CNTT reference architecture, leveraging existing OPNFV Intake Process. Upstream projects will define features/capabilities, test scenarios, and test cases to augment existing OVP test harnesses to be executed via the OVP Ecosystem.

3rd Party test platforms may also be leveraged, if desired.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_certifying_methodlogy.jpg" alt="Certification Methodology" title="Certification Methodology" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure:</b> Figure: Certification Methodology</p>

<a name="8.6.2"></a>
### 8.6.2 OVP/CVC Certification Strategy & Vehicle.
<p><strong>NFVI+VNF validations consist of a three part process for Compliance, Validation, and Performance.&nbsp; </strong>Adherenence to <strong>Security</strong> standards are equally important and addressed in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>The three part verificaiton process includes <strong>NFVI Manifest Validations</strong>, <strong>Emprical Baseline measurements against targeted VNF families</strong>, and <strong>Candidate VNF verifications</strong>.&nbsp; More specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NFVI Verification (</strong><em>Compliance</em><strong>):</strong> NFVI is the SUT, ensuring NFVI is compliant with specs of Ref Model and Ref Architecture accomplished with&nbsp;<strong>Manifest Validations</strong> (performed via Echo Tests)&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Empirical Validation with Reference VNF (</strong><em>Validation</em><strong>):</strong> NFVI is the SUT, ensuring NFVI runs with Golden VNFs and is instrumented to objectively validate resources through consumption and measurement</li>
<li><strong>Candidate VNF Certification (</strong><em>Validation &amp; Performance</em><strong>):</strong> VNF is the SUT, ensuring VNFs operate with Ref Model and Ref Arch leveraging VVP/CVP/VFNSDK Test Suites</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Ensures NFVI+VNF is free from known security vulnerabilities, utilizing industry standard cyber security frameworks <em>(Refer to CNTT Chapter 7 Security for additional test/verification details)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Validations are performed against an <strong>Infrastructure Profile Catalog</strong>, <strong>VNF performance profile</strong>, and <strong>targeted VNF class</strong> or family for baseline measurements.</p>
<p>The <strong>Infrastucture Profile Catalog</strong>&nbsp;contains the following attributes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile is a collection of (limited) options offered by the infrastructure to the VNF
<ul>
<li>Capabilities</li>
<li>Metrics</li>
<li>Compute flavours</li>
<li>Interface options</li>
<li>Storage extensions</li>
<li>Acceleration capabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Profiles are offered to VNFs as an instance types with predefined compute flavours (T-shirt size)
<ul>
<li>A particular set of options is an instance type</li>
<li>Compute flavours: S, M, L</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VNF performance profiles</strong>, for which NFVI validations will support and be verified against, are defined as basic, network intensive, and compute intensive. Details for each of these profiles can be found in <a href=https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/master/doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter02.md#2.3>chapter 2.3</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Figure:</b> Figure: Basic(B), Network(N), Compute(C) VNF Categories</p>

<p><strong>Targeted VNF Classes/Families </strong>for baseline measurements are described in <a href=https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/master/doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter02.md#2.2>chapter 2.2</a>.

<a name="8.6.3"></a>
### 8.6.3 Best Practices.
<ul>
<li>Standardized test methodology / flow, Test Plan, and Test Case Suites</li>
<li>Integration with Dovetail and OVP flow (code, docs, cert criteria, etc.)</li>
<li>Leveraging ONAP Network and Service Models, with identified VNF-specific parameters</li>
<li>Standardized certification criteria</li>
<li>Define CNTT ref arch as scenarios, and have all test cases for the ref arch be involved in OVP (could also be addressed in OVP as CNTT test)</li>
<li>Add test cases from operators, which operators already tested in their environment</li>
</ul>

<a name="8.6.4"></a>
### 8.6.4 NFVI Profiles reference implementations.

For compliance, verification, and certification, of NFVI solutions provided for a given NFVI Profile, it is required to have a reference implementation of each profile so it can be used for compliance, validation, and certification.

Those reference implementations need to reflect on their corresponding profiles and deliver all metrics and capabilities promised. They need to use open source components. Figure below shows the various reference implementations required for each profile, they are:

- NFVI SW Reference implementation.
- NFVI HW Reference implementation.
- VNF reference implementation.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_NFVI_ref_profiles_impementations.jpg" alt="NFVI RI Profiles" title="NFVI RI Profiles" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure:</b> Figure: Reference NFVI Profiles Implementation</p>

<a name="8.6.5"></a>
### 8.6.5 Vendor supplied NFVI solutions.

Infrastructure Abstraction and Profiling allows NFVI SW vendors to provide solutions that are suitable for a given profile (as demonstrated in Figure below). Having NFVI solutions tailored towards a given profile makes it easier to verify, certify and test that solution against that profile using the reference implementation of the profile mentioned previously.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_NFVI_vendor_supplied_sw_solutions.jpg" alt="NFVI Vendor SW Solutions" title="NFVI Vendor SW Solutions" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure:</b> Figure: Vendor Supplied NFVI SW Solutions</p>

Similarly, Infrastructure Abstraction and Profiling allows NFVI HW vendors to provide solutions that are suitable for a given profile (as demonstrated in Figure below). Having NFVI hardware solutions tailored towards a given profile makes it easier to verify, certify and test that hardware solution against that profile using the reference implementation of the profile mentioned previously.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_NFVI_vendor_supplied_hw_solutions.jpg" alt="NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" title="NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure:</b> Figure: Vendor Supplied NFVI HW Solutions</p>

<a name="8.6.6"></a>
### 8.6.6 NFVI Compliance, Verification, and Certification.

Infrastructure abstraction and profiling makes it easier for a given NFVI SW solutions to be validated, certified and tested against the profile it is intended for.

Having a deterministic NFVI metrics and capabilities expected for a given profile, allows NFVI SW solutions to be characterised, validated, and verified against those metrics and capabilities, and therefore report the results in a standard format. This will allow operators to understand in depth the details and the differentiation a given solution can provide against other options.

Figure below demonstrates how a given NFVI SW solution can be validated and certified against a given profile by using a reference HW implementation and a reference NFVI implementation.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_NFVI_certifying_vendor_sw_solutions.jpg" alt="Certifying NFVI Vendor SW Solutions" title="Certifying NFVI Vendor SW Solutions" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure:</b> Figure: Certifying Vendor NFVI SW Solutions</p>

Similarly, to characterise, validate, and certify NFVI HW solution against a given profile, both NFVI SW reference implementation and a VNF reference implementation are needed as demonstrated as in Figure below.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_NFVI_certifying_vendor_hw_solutions.jpg" alt="Certifying NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" title="Certifying NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" width="100%"/></p>

Finally, NFVI vendors can characterise, validate, and certify an entire NFVI platform (both SW & HW) against a given profile by using a VNF reference implementation as shown in Figure below.

### 8.6.7 VNF Compliance, Validation, and Certification.

Standardising on Infrastructure profiles allows VNFs to be characterised, validated, and certified against a given profile by using reference NFVI implementations as demonstrated in Figure below. Where VNFs are using multiple profiles (different VNF-C written against different profiles), multiple Reference NFVI implementations should be used.

<a name="8.7.1"></a>
### 8.7.1 Dependencies, Recommendations, Assumptions

**Assumptions**
NFVI+VNF testing will be considered **Testable** if the follow qualifiers are present in a test execution, and subsequent result:

- Ability to perform Conformance, or Verification of Artifacts to ensure designs (RM/RA/RI) are delivered per specification

- Ability to Control (or manipulate), manifestations of RM/RA/RI for the purposes to adjust the test environment, and respective cases, scenarios, and apparatus, to support actual test validations

- Ability to monitor, measure, and report, Validations performed against a target, controlled system under test

In addition, respective Entrance criteria is a prerequisite which needs to be satisfied for NFVI+VNF to be considered **Testable**.  Refer to [https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/chapter08/doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter08.md#8.7.3](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/chapter08/doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter08.md#8.7.3 "Entrance & Exit Criteria") for detailed information.

**Dependencies**
NFVI+VNF verification will rely upon test harnesses, test tools, and test suites provided by upstream OPNFV projects, including dovetaill, yardstick, and Bottleneck. These upstream projects will be reviewed semi-annually to verify they are still healthy and active projects. Over time, the projects representing the certification process may change, but test parity is required if new test suites are added in place of older, stale projects.

- NFVI+VNF verifications will be performed against well defined instance types consisting of a HW and SW Profile, Configured Options, and Applied Extensions (See image.)

![NFVI+VNF Instance Type](../figures/ch8_NFVI_VNF_Instance_Type.jpg)

### 8.7.4 Test Frameworks

#### 8.7.4.1 Functest

[Functest](https://functest.readthedocs.io/en/stable-iruya/) was initially
created to verify OPNFV Installers and Scenarios and then to publish fair,
trustable and public results regarding the status of the different opensource
technologies, especially for Neutron backends (e.g. Neutron agents,
OpenDaylight, OVN, etc.). It has been continuously updated to offer the best
testing coverage for any kind of OpenStack and Kubernetes deployments
including production environments. It also ensures that the platforms meet
Network Functions Virtualization requirements by running and testing VNFs
amongst all tests available.


Functest is driven by a true verification of the platform under test as opposed
to the interoperability programs such as
[RefStack](https://refstack.openstack.org/) or
[OPNFV Verification Program](https://www.opnfv.org/verification) which select
a small subset of Functional tests passing in many different
opensource software combinations:
- tests are skipped if an optional support is missing (e.g.
  [Barbican](https://docs.openstack.org/barbican/latest/) or networking
  features such as
  [BGPVPN interconnection](https://docs.openstack.org/networking-bgpvpn/latest/)
  or
  [Service Function Chaining](https://docs.openstack.org/networking-sfc/latest/))
- tests are parameterized (e.g. shared vs non-shared live migration)
- blacklist mechanisms are available if needed

It should be noted that
[the RefStack lists](https://refstack.openstack.org/#/guidelines) are included
as they are in Functest in the next 3 dedicated testcases:
- refstack_compute (OpenStack Powered Compute)
- refstack_object (OpenStack Powered Object Storage)
- refstack_platform (OpenStack Powered Platform)

Functest also integrates
[Kubernetes End-to-end tests](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/22/kubernetes-end-to-end-testing-for-everyone/) and allows verifying Kubernetes Conformance (see
[k8s-conformance](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/job/functest-kubernetes-opnfv-functest-kubernetes-smoke-iruya-k8s_conformance-run/206/console)).

Dovetail (OVP) mostly leverages on Functest but only runs a small part of
Functest (~15% of all functional tests, no benchmarking tests, no VNF
deployment and testing). It's worth mentioning that Functest is patched to
[disable API verification](https://github.com/opnfv/dovetail/tree/master/etc/patches/functest/disable-api-validation) which has differed from OpenStack rules for
years.

Then Functest conforms with the upstream rules (versions, code quality, etc.)
and especially their
[gates](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/devstack-gate.html)
(a.k.a. the automatic verification prior to any code review)
to preserve the quality between code and deployment.
In that case, Functest can be considered as a smooth and lightweight
integration of tests developed upstream (and the Functest team directly
contributes in these projects:
[Rally](https://github.com/openstack/rally-openstack),
[Tempest](https://github.com/openstack/tempest), etc.).
It's worth mentioning that, as opposed to the OpenStack Gates leveraging on
[DevStack](https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/), it can check the same
already deployed SUT over and over even from a
[Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). Here the testcases can be
executed in parallel vs the same deployment instead of being executed vs
different pools of virtual machines.

Here are the functional tests (>2000) running in OpenStack gates integrated in
Functest Smoke (see
[Functest daily jobs](https://build.opnfv.org/ci/view/functest/job/functest-iruya-daily/190/) for more details):

| Testcases                  | Gates              |
| :------------------------- | :----------------- |
| tempest_full               | General            |
| tempest_slow               | General            |
| tempest_scenario           | General            |
| neutron-tempest-plugin-api | Neutron            |
| patrole                    | Patrole            |
| barbican                   | Barbican           |
| networking-bgpvpn          | Networking BGP VPN |
| networking-sfc             | Networking SFC     |

To complete functional testing, Functest also integrates a few
[performance tools](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/performance-docs/methodologies/tools.html)
(2-3 hours) as proposed by OpenStack:

| Testcases  | Benchmarking                |
| :--------- | :-------------------------- |
| rally_full | Control Plane (API) testing |
| rally_jobs | Control Plane (API) testing |
| vmtp       | Data Plane testing          |
| shaker     | Data Plane testing          |

And VNFs automatically deployed and tested :

| Testcases    | Benchmarking                        |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------- |
| cloudify     | Cloudify deployment                 |
| cloudify_ims | Clearwater IMS deployed via Coudify |
| heat_ims     | Clearwater IMS deployed via Heat    |
| vyos_vrouter | VyOS deployed via Cloudify          |
| juju_epc     | OAI deployed via Juju               |

Functest should be considered as a whole as it meets multiple objectives about
the reference implementation:
- verify all APIs (services, advances, features, etc.) exposed by the reference
  implementation
- compare the reference implementation and local deployments from a functional
  standpoint and from OpenStack control plane and dataplane capabilities

It's worth mentioning that Functest already takes into account the first CNTT
[profiles](https://git.opnfv.org/functest/tree/functest/ci/config_patch.yaml#n2).
CNTT should simply add the next Functest inputs according the reference
implementation:
- [Functest inputs](https://github.com/opnfv/functest/blob/stable/iruya/functest/utils/env.py#L17)
- [tempest specific configuration](https://github.com/opnfv/functest/blob/stable/iruya/functest/opnfv_tests/openstack/tempest/custom_tests/tempest_conf.yaml)

The following five test categories have been identified as minimal testing required to verify NFVI interoperability to satisfy the needs of VNF developer teams.

<b><u>Test Categories</u></b>
<ol>
<li>Baremetal - validations</li> - We will validate Control and compute nodes hardware.
<li>VNF Interoperability - validations</li> - After VNF on boarded we are validating end to end openstack resources like Tenant, Network (L2/L3), CPU Pining, security policies, Affinity anti-affinity roles and flavours etc.
<li>Compute Component - validations</li> - Validate/Document VMs status and connectivity result after performing each of listed steps. Best candidate for this testing would be identify compute node that holds VMs which has l2 and l3 connectivity.
<li>Control Plane Component- validations</li> - We are validating RabbitMQ, Ceph, Mariadb and Openstack components like nova, glance, heat, keystone API and resillency test.

## 8.8 Test Results

**NOT MVP**

Test suites will be categorized as functional or performance based. Results reporting will be communicated as a boolean (pass/fail). The pass/fail determination for performance-based test cases will be made by comparing results against a baseline.
Example performance-based metrics include, but are not limited to: resource utilization, response times, latency, and sustained throughput per second (TPS).

<a name="8.8.1"></a>
### 8.8.1 Measurements

**NOT MVP**

Measurements and respective certification(s).
e.g. OVP Testing Ecosystem badge (with link to certification with posted results)

Test validations will be corroborated, and confirmed, with direct comparison between measured results and documented non-functional requirements (NFRs) for applications, hardware and software configuration settings, and host systems.  Throughput, latency, concurrent connections/threads, are all examples of non-functional requirements which specify criteria which can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours of the application which are defined by functional requirements.

This section attempts to summarize a categorical list of metrics used for test validations.  **For a complete list of metrics, and requirements, please visit [Chapter 4 of the Reference Model](https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/master/doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter04.md "Chapter 4 - Infrastructure Capabilities, Metrics, and Catalog").**

**STORAGE and IOPS**

_**IOPS**_ validations for Storage, and/or Storage Extensions, will be included as part of the final NFVI verification, and validation, process.  

From a definition perspective, IOPS is the standard unit of measurement for I/O (Input/Output) operations per second. This measurement is a performance-based measurement and is usually seen written as**(1)**:

- **Total IOPS**: Average number of I/O operations per second.
- **Read IOPS**: Average number of read I/O operations per second.
- **Write IOPS**: Average number of write I/O operations per second.

For example, if you have a disk that is capable of doing a 100 IOPS, it means that it is theoretically capable of issuing a 100 read and or write operations per second.  This is in theory.  In reality, additional time is needed to actually process the 100 reads/writes.  This additional time is referred to as "latency", which reduces the total IOPS that is calculated, and measured.  Latency needs needs to be measured, and included in the IOPS calculation.  Latency will tell us how long it takes to process a single I/O request, and is generally in the 2 millisecond (ms) range per IO operation for a physical disk, through 20+ ms, at which time users will notice an impact in their experience**(2)**.  

Additional factors to consider when measuring IOPS:


- Take into consideration the percentage of Input (write) vs. Output (reads) operations, as Writes can be more resource intensive.
- Determine if Reads were performed from Cache, as this this may (will) result in faster performance, and faster IOPS.
- Confirm the storage types (Physical, RAID), as storage arrays with linear, or sequential reading/writing may (will) be slower.
- Identify the block size used, as using large block sizes vs. small block sizes can (will) impact IOPS performance.
- Determine Hard Disk Speeds (HDD in RPMs) used, as the higher the RPMS, the potential for faster IOPS performance.
- Quantify the number of disk controllers used to process the number of requested IO requests.
- Determine the specific work-load requirements, as this will dictate speed, controllers, disk RPM, and latency tolerances.  

For additional insight, or deeper understanding and reading of IOPS, refer to the references below.

### 8.9.1 Performance & Resiliency - Measurements, Testing

**NOT MVP**

#### 8.9.1.1 Performance Measurements

The following table contains a lists of performance measurements, and/or capabilities, to be captured where feasible during test validations.  More specifically, the table contains:



- Exposed performance metrics per VNFC, vNIC or vCPU.  Specifically exposed performance metrics use a single VNF (PVP) dataplane test setup in a single host.  (e.g. _\*e.nfvi.per.met\*_)



- Monitoring capabilities available by NFVI.  The availability of these capabilities will be determined by the instance type used by the workloads. (e.g. _\*i.nfvi.mon.cap\*_)



- Internal performance metrics per NFVI node.  Specifically internal performance metrics use a baseline (Phy2Phy) dataplane test setup in a single host. (e.g. _\*i.nfvi.per.met\*_)

> _**NOTE**:  Refer to RM Chapter 4, <a href="https://github.com/cntt-n/CNTT/blob/master/doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter04.md">Infrastructure Capabilities, Metrics, and Catalogue</a>, for a list performance measurements and capabilities internal to the infrastructure._

*Note 1*: Network measurement configuration should define the configuration to be used to measure the values of e.nfvi.per.met.002, e.nfvi.per.met.003 and e.nfvi.per.met.004. The value should follow the rules set up in ETSI GS NFV-TST 009 V3.1.1 (2018-10) Chapter 6.2 with the note that PVP can also mean container setup on bare metal while PVVP can also mean container setup on top of VM-s. Also it should be noted that Phy2Phy is different in case of VM and container setup as in case of containers there is no vSwitch.
