## 8.1 Introduction

Having deterministic NFVI metrics and capabilities expected for a given profile allows NFVI solutions to be characterised, validated, and verified against those metrics and capabilities, and therefore report the results in a standard format. This will allow operators to understand in depth the details and the differentiation a given solution can provide against other options.

Additionally, standardising on infrastructure profiles allows VNFs to be characterised, validated, and certified against a given profile by using reference NFVI implementations as demonstrated in Figure 8-1 below. Where VNFs are using multiple profiles (different VNF-C written against different profiles), multiple Reference NFVI implementations should be used.

## 8.2 Requirements

### 8.2.1 Reference Implementations Requirements

For compliance, verification, and certification of NFVI solutions provided for a given NFVI Profile, it is required to have a reference implementation of each profile so it can be used for compliance, validation, and certification purposes.

Those reference implementations need to reflect on their corresponding profiles and deliver all metrics and capabilities promised. They need to use open source components. Figure 8-1 below shows the various reference implementations required for each profile, they are:

- NFVI SW Reference implementation.
- NFVI HW Reference implementation.
- VNF Reference implementation.

### 8.2.1 Certification Requirements

<a name="8.2.2.1"></a>
#### 8.2.2.1 Certification of Vendor supplied NFVI solutions.

Infrastructure Abstraction and Profiling allows NFVI SW vendors to provide solutions that are suitable for a given profile (as demonstrated in Figure 8-2 below). Having NFVI solutions tailored towards a given profile makes it easier to verify, certify, and test that solution against that profile using the reference implementation of the profile mentioned previously.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 8-2:</b> Vendor Supplied NFVI SW Solutions</p>

Similarly, Infrastructure Abstraction and Profiling allows NFVI HW vendors to provide solutions that are suitable for a given profile (as demonstrated in Figure 8-3 below). Having NFVI hardware solutions tailored towards a given profile makes it easier to verify, certify, and test that hardware solution against that profile using the reference implementation of the profile mentioned previously.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_NFVI_vendor_supplied_hw_solutions.jpg" alt="NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" title="NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" width="70%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 8-3:</b> Vendor Supplied NFVI HW Solutions</p>

Figure 8-4 below demonstrates how a given NFVI SW solution can be validated and certified against a given profile by using a reference HW implementation and a reference NFVI implementation.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 8-4:</b> Certifying Vendor NFVI SW Solutions</p>

Similarly, to characterise, validate, and certify NFVI HW solution against a given profile, both NFVI SW reference implementation and a VNF reference implementation are needed as demonstrated as in Figure 8-5 below.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch8_NFVI_certifying_vendor_hw_solutions.jpg" alt="Certifying NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" title="Certifying NFVI Vendor HW Solutions" width="70%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 8-5:</b> Certifying Vendor NFVI HW Solutions</p>

Finally, NFVI vendors can characterise, validate, and certify an entire NFVI platform (both SW & HW) against a given profile by using a VNF reference implementation as shown in Figure 8-6 below.

### 8.2.4 Test Case Selection Requirements

This section lists requirements test cases must fulfill to be eligible for
inclusion in the NFVI and/or VNF compliance test suite.  These requirements act
as a checklist to gate the inclusion of test cases.


| Ref # | Category   | Description |
|----|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `req.tests.15` | Scope          | Test cases **must** be traceable to a requirement based on the reference model or a reference architecture. |

    - Openstack API endpoint is reachable and working for that zone.
    - Compute zones and cinder types verified.

      1. Compatibility Checks (e.g. documented s/w, driver rev levels, etc, in use and confirmed compatible between Platform and VNF); 
      1. Integration Checks (e.g. empirical validation confirming positive performance and stability between Platform and VNF; for example, packet loss within acceptable tolerances)
1. **End User Consideration**
    - Component redundancy to ensure graceful updates without disruption of services
    - Thin provisioning storage should handle actual full quota usage cases

    - Supports all required network functionality (all protocols, service chaining, VLAN trunking, QoS marking, probe/mirror, etc)
    - Supports NFV migration
    - Supports snapshots and backups of large volumes
    - Pre-check or audit failures during NFV deployment should allow follow-up mitigation, when possible, rather than killing deployment and rolling back

### 8.3.2 Quality Assurance

**Assumptions**
NFVI+VNF testing will be considered **Testable** if the follow qualifiers are present in a test execution, and subsequent result:

- Ability to perform Conformance, or Verification of Artifacts to ensure designs (RM/RA/RI) are delivered per specification

- Ability to Control (or manipulate), manifestations of RM/RA/RI for the purposes to adjust the test environment, and respective cases, scenarios, and apparatus, to support actual test validations

- Ability to monitor, measure, and report, Validations performed against a target, controlled system under test

In addition, respective Entrance criteria is a prerequisite which needs to be satisfied for NFVI+VNF to be considered **Testable**.

**Dependencies**
NFVI+VNF verification will rely upon test harnesses, test tools, and test suites.  

- NFVI+VNF verifications will be performed against well defined instance types consisting of a HW and SW Profile, Configured Options, and Applied Extensions (See image.)

### 8.3.3 Test Categories | Cases

The following five test categories have been identified as minimal testing required to verify NFVI interoperability to satisfy the needs of VNF developer teams.

- **Baremetal**: Validate Control and compute nodes hardware.
- **VNF**: After VNF on boarded we are validating end to end resources like Tenant, Network (L2/L3), CPU Pining, security policies, Affinity anti-affinity roles, and flavours etc.
- **Compute Component**: Validate/Document VMs status and connectivity result after performing each of the listed steps. Best candidate for this testing would be identify compute node that holds VMs which has l2 and l3 connectivity.
- **Control Plane Component**: Validating different Control plane components and API.
- **Security**: Validating user RBAC Roles and User group policies.
