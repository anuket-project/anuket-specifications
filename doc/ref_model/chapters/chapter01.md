## 1.1 Overview
The Reference Model (RM) specification is written on the basis of complete infrastructure abstraction and exposing set of capabilities, resources, and interfaces to workloads which they will be written against. The aim of Reference Model is to be agnostic across VM-based and container-based workloads and this document should act as a "catalogue" for VNF/CNF application designers to understand everything they need to know from the underlying infrastructure they are writing their application to run on.

## 1.2 Terminology
To help guide the reader, a glossary [Reference Model Terminology](../../tech/glossary.md) provides an introduction to the main terms used within this document and throughout the project in general. These definitions are, with a few exceptions, based on the [ETSI GR NFV 003 V1.5.1 (2020-01)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV/001_099/003/01.05.01_60/gr_NFV003v010501p.pdf) definitions.  In a few cases, they have been modified to avoid deployment technology dependencies only when it seems necessary to avoid confusion.

## 1.3 Principles
This section introduces the high-level principles of infrastructure abstraction and profiling that will be used in context of this document.

1. A top-level objective of the CNTT is to build a single, overarching Reference Model with the smallest number of Reference Architectures tied to it as is practical. Two principles are introduced in support of these objectives:
    - **Minimize Architecture proliferation by stipulating compatible features be contained within a single Architecture as much as possible:**
      - Features which are compatible, meaning they are not mutually exclusive and can coexist in the same cloud infrastructure instance, shall be incorporated into the same Reference Architecture. For example, IPv4 and IPv6 should be captured in the same Architecture, because they don't interfere with each other
      - Focus on the commonalities of the features over the perceived differences. Seek an approach that allows small differences to be handled at either the low-level design or implementation stage. For example, assume the use of existing common APIs over new ones.

    - **Create an additional Architecture only when incompatible elements are unavoidable:**
      - Creating additional Architectures is limited to when incompatible elements are desired by Taskforce members. For example, if one member desires KVM be used as the hypervisor, and another desires ESXi be used as the hypervisor, and no compromise or mitigation* can be negotiated, the Architecture could be forked, subject to review and vote to approve by the CNTT technical Working Group, such that one Architecture would be KVM-based and the other would be ESXi-based.

        >*Depending on the relationships and substitutability of the component(s) in question, it may be possible to mitigate component incompatibility by creating annexes to a single Architecture, rather than creating an additional Architecture. With this approach, the infrastructure architecture designers might implement the Architecture as described in the reference document, however when there is a potential for incompatibility for  particular component, they would select their preferred option from one of the relevant annexes. For example, if one member wanted to use Ceph, and another member wanted to use Swift, assuming the components are equally compatible with the rest of the Architecture, there could be one annex for the Ceph implementation and one annex for the Swift implementation.
1. Cloud infrastructure provides abstract and physical resources corresponding to:
   - Compute resources.
   - Storage resources.
   - Memory resources.
   - Networking resources. (Limited to connectivity services only).
   - Acceleration resources.
1. Cloud infrastructure exposed resources should be supplier independent.
1. All cloud infrastructure Application Programming Interfaces (API) must ensure Interoperability (multi-vendor, components substitution), drive Simplification, and open source implementations that have an open governance model (e.g. come from Open Communities or Standards Development Organizations). Through such APIs will cloud infrastructure resources be discovered/monitored by management entities, configured on behalf of VNFs and consumed by VNFs.
1. VNFs should be modular and be designed to utilise the minimum resources required for the service.
1. Cloud infrastructure shall support pre-defined and parameterized sizes.
   - These pre-defined sizes will evolve over time.
1. Cloud infrastructure provides certain resources, capabilities and features and virtual applications (VA) should only consume these resources, capabilities and features.
1. VNFs that are designed to take advantage of cloud infrastructure accelerations shall still be able to run without these accelerations, however with the understanding that there will be potential performance impacts.
1. Workloads shall not require hardware-dependent software
   - This is in support of VNF abstraction, enabling portability across the Infra and simplification of VNF design
   - This pertains to features that expose hardware directly to workloads, such as PCIe PassThrough (PCI-PT) and capabilities that use these features, for example, SR-IOV
   - Use of critical features in this category are governed by policies in the RM Appendix and referenced in RM Chapter 4
1. Specific internal hardware details shall not be exposed above the Infra+VIM layers
   - This is in support of VNF abstraction, enabling portability across the Infra and simplification of VNF design
   - This pertains to features that operate at detailed levels of hardware granularity, such as EPA

## 1.6 Relationship to other industry projects
The CNTT work is not done in a vacuum.  The intention from the beginning was to utilize the work from other Open Source and standards bodies within the industry. Some of the projects, but by no means all, that are related in some way to the CNTT efforts include:

 -	ETSI NFV ISG
 -	OpenStack
 -	OPNFV
 -	ONAP
 -	CNCF
 -	MEF
 -	TM Forum
 - OSM (ETSi Open Source MANO project)
 - VMWare (While not an Open Source project, VMWare is a commonly used platform used for VNF deployments in the telecom industry)

The ETSI NFV ISG is very closely related to the CNTT, in that it is a group that is working on supporting technologies for NFV applications. To facilitate more collaboration as the project matures, the CNTT Reference Model's scope has been purposely aligned to the ETSI NFV ISG Infrastructure plus the VIM (Virtualised Infrastructure Manager), inclusive of their external reference points, as specified by [ETSI GS NFV 002](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/002/01.02.01_60/gs_NFV002v010201p.pdf). **Figure 1-2** illustrates which functional blocks of the ETSI NFV Architecture are in scope for CNTT.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch01_etsi_archi_mapping_v2.PNG" alt="mapping" title="Mapping to ETSI NFV architecture" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 1-2:</b> Mapping to ETSI NFV architecture</p>

Following the ETSI model, **Figure 1-2** also depicts the VIM, which controls and manages the cloud infrastructure, and while technically not part of the cloud infrastructure, the VIM is included in the CNTT scope, due to its role as a manager serving as a bridge between the underlying NVFI and the VNF applications. The interactions between cloud infrastructure and VIM will be part of this document as infrastructure resources management and orchestration have a strong impact on the cloud infrastructure.  These interactions and interfaces will be detailed in  **Chapter 7 API & Interfaces**.

The CNTT is also closely aligned with OVP, an open source, community-led compliance and verification program that demonstrates the readiness and availability of commercial NFV products and services, including cloud infrastructure and VNFs, using OPNFV. OVP combines open source-based automated compliance and verification testing for multiple parts of the NFV stack specifications established by ONAP, multiple SDOs such as ETSI and GSMA, and the LF Networking End User Advisory Group (EUAG).

Once the CNTT Reference Models and Architectures are implemented and tested via OPNFV (Reference Implementations), commercial products adhering to these specifications can undergo an enhanced OVP’s VNF and cloud infrastructure compliance testing for establishing baseline conformance and offering interoperability.  More details about the testing and verification requirements are found in **Chapter 08 - Conformance, Verification, and Certification**.

<!--
There will be dedicated OVP hacking tracks to facilitate VNF vendor onboarding and testing. More information on the work and how to get involved can be found at the following links.  
- https://www.lfnetworking.org/ovp.
- Information on the existing 11 OPNFV Verified products to date is available here: https://nfvi-verified.lfnetworking.org/#/
-->

The CNTT will collaborate with the respective API workgroups of SDOs (ETSI, MEF, TM Forum) as much as possible.  However, to collate on the relevant APIs from these SDOs in some cases requires special permission since information might not be available to the public.  For example. MEF LSO APIs & TM Forum OpenAPIs are accessible by members only.

## 1.7 Out of Scope Components
While the nature of the reference model might seem quite broad, the following areas are not at this time part of the scope of this effort.  
- Hardware specifications: beyond the abstracted high-level CPU, memory, network interface and storage elements.  The intention is to write the document so that it is general enough that any vendor hardware can be used in the implementation without making significant changes to the model.
- VNF and application specifications: Other than the API interfaces when they directly need to touch the VNFs themselves, the intention is to assume the VNF application is a blackbox that the cloud infrastructure is providing resources to.  The majority of interactions for lifecycle management of the VNFs will be through the VIM whenever possible.
- Company specific requirements: This document is designed to be general enough that most operators and others in the Open Source communities will be able
