## A.1 Goals
This Appendix has two goals:
1. Provide guidance to VNF or more generally Application vendors on how to consume CNTT Reference Model and Architectures
2. Provide usable definitions of maturity levels for VNF software architecture between Physical-to-Virtual migration and “Cloud Native”.

The goal is not to be prescriptive on how to re-architect existing or architect new applications but rather staying within scope of focusing on interface and interaction between applications and platform.

## A.3 Exception List

As Part of the [Transition Plan](../../gov/chapters/chapter09.md#9.2) described in the adoption strategy, following table explains the exceptions allowed in this RM release. The list of Exceptions described here are considered to be against CNTT principles and will be removed in future releases as soon as an alternative technology that is aligned with CNTT principles develops and matures.

## A.5 Hardware-Dependent Coding Policies

As described in the Principles sections of RM Chapter 1, features that require hardware-dependent code in the workload are prohibited in CNTT compliant implementations. This principle is henceforth referred to as the "Abstraction Principle". Note, this is not the case for the Compute node host software (e.g., host OS). Within the Infra, hosts are expected to have software that is customized for the specific hardware equipped. However, the intent is that these software drivers and higher layers will abstract the Capabilities they enable, thereby exposing them with an open API. An example of exposing capabilities in this manner is implemented in the Virtio family of APIs. This requirement is in support of VNF abstraction and portability of VNFs across the Infra landscape.

CNTT realizes there are implications to this and limitations to the ability to live by the Abstraction Principle. A textbook example of a Capability that transgresses this principle, is SR-IOV. Other, less notable, yet very important examples include vGPUs and other acceleration hardware, such as FPGA. A less obvious, yet critically important example is the VNF program(s) itself. As workloads execute native microarchitecture opcodes, those instruction sets effectively constitute an ABI (Application Binary Interface). Additionally, these programs may or may not, attempt to execute vendor-specific extensions to standard instruction sets, such as x86 or ARM.

Solving the problems associated with implementing the Abstraction Principle is a work in progress. CNTT has not solved all of the associated problems, nor has the industry. As technology evolves and more designs incorporate cloud native concepts, these problems will be addressed. This appendix is specifically intended to provide CNTT policies to manage these situations as they exist today,   and their exceptions and transitions, as the technology around and supporting the Abstraction Principle matures.

Several specific technology areas have been identified by CNTT as using an ABI impacted by the Abstraction Principle, as follows:
- SR-IOV
- GPU/NPU
- FPGA/Other Acceleration
- CPU Instruction Sets and Extensions

The preceding list is not exhaustive; technologies will be added as required.

Current CNTT Policies:

**SR-IOV:**

CNTT recognizes that today, SR-IOV provides a critical Capability for increased throughput over network interfaces at an economical cost. As such, the CNTT approach to SR-IOV is to (detailed policy language under development; to be tied in with VNF Evolution).

Without arguing for or against SR-IOV, CNTT provides the following anecdotes which have been raised in discussions over SR-IOV:
- SR-IOV mitigates the need for duplicated servicing of interrupts from unbuffered (i.e. small buffer) NICs, however it does not reduce the number of frame reception driven interrupts which much be serviced.
- SR-IOV increases the Fabric management complexity, as encapsulation must be applied by the ToR/Leaf interface and the encapsulation must be managed as VNFs and/or networks are added/deleted from the Tenant. Therefore, performance isn't the only factor; fabric touch points and Service Chaining must also be considered.
- Indications are that technologies such as DPDK, VPP, FD.io and others offer comparable throughput, today.<sup>(Citations Needed)</sup>

## A.6 Miscellaneous
### A.6.1 VNF Network Monitoring Capabilities - UseCase.
Network Monitoring capabilities exposed by NFVI Platform are used for the passive observation of VNF-specific traffic traversing the NFVI when:
* Performance issues and/or packet drops reported in VNF
* Determining performance bottle necks at VNF level
* Doing anomaly detection and network forensics

**Note:** It is responsibility of NFVI Platform to expose capability to create virtual interface having mirrored traffic from monitored VNF. This port can be attached to Monitoring VNF so that all traffic from Monitored VNF would be available for troubleshooting/debugging purpose.
