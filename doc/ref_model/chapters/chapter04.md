Infrastructure exposes sets of capabilities, metrics, compute flavours, interface options, storage extensions, and acceleration capabilities to VNFs. Those sets are offered to VNFs in form of instance types with their corresponding options and extensions.

The idea of the infrastructure instances catalogue is to have a predefined set of instance types with a predefined set of compute flavours (sometimes referred to as T-shirt sizes) which VNF vendors use to build their VNFs. Each VNF uses one or more of those compute flavours (with one or more of offered instance types) to build its overall functionality as illustrated in **Figure 4-1**.

## 4.1 Compute flavours

Flavours represent the compute, memory, storage capacity, and management network resource templates that are used to create the VMs on the compute hosts. Each VM instance is given a flavour (resource template), which determines the instance's core, memory and storage characteristics. 

Flavours can also specify secondary ephemeral storage, swap disk, etc. A compute flavour geometry consists of the following elements:

Element |Description 
--------|----------
Name	|A descriptive name
Virtual compute resources (aka vCPUs) |Number of virtual compute resources (vCPUs) presented to the instance.
Memory MB	|Instance memory in megabytes. 
Ephemeral/Local Disk |Specifies the size of an ephemeral data disk that exists only for the life of the instance. Default value is 0.<br />The ephemeral disk may be partitioned into boot (base image) and swap space disks. 
Is Public	|Boolean value, whether flavor is available to all users or private to the project it was created in. Defaults to True.

<p align="center"><b>Table 4-1:</b> Flavour Geometry Specification.</p>

###  4.1.1	Predefined Compute flavours
The intent of the following flavours list is to be comprehensive and yet effective to cover both IT and NFV workloads. The compute flavours are specified relative to the standardised “large” flavour. The standard “large” flavour configuration consists of 4 vCPUs, 8 GB of RAM and 80 GB of local disk, and the resulting instance will have a management interface of 1 Gbps. The “medium” flavour is half the size of a large and small is half the size of medium. The tiny flavour is a special sized flavour.

>_*Note:*_ Customised (Parameterized) flavours can be used in concession by operators and , if needed, are  created using TOSCA, HEAT templates and/or VIM APIs.

.conf |vCPU ("c") |RAM ("r") |Local Disk ("d") | Management Interface
-----|------------|----------|-----|-----
.tiny	|1	|512 MB	|1 GB	|1 Gbps
.small	|1	|2 GB	|20 GB 	|1 Gbps
.medium	|2	|4 GB	|40 GB	|1 Gbps
.large	|4	|8 GB	|80 GB	|1 Gbps
.2xlarge*	|8	|16 GB	|160 GB	|1 Gbps
.4xlarge*	|16	|32 GB	|320 GB	|1 Gbps

<p align="center"><b>Table 4-2:</b> Predefined Compute flavours.</p>

> _*These compute flavours are intended to be used for transitional purposes and VNF vendors are expected to consume smaller flavours and adopt micro server's designs for their VNFs_

<a name="4.2"></a>
## 4.2 Network Interface Specifications

The network interface specifications extend the flavour customization to specify the network interface “n” followed by the interface bandwidth (in Gbps) and an alphabetic character defining the number of interfaces with that bandwidth; multiple network interface bandwidths, where network interfaces of different bandwidths exist, can be specified by repeating the “n” option.
```
<network interface bandwidth option> :: <”n”><number (bandwidth in Gbps)>< # of interfaces of that bandwidth>
<number of interfaces> :: <”” | “D” | “T” | “Q” | “P” | “H”> 
where “” represents 1x, “D” 2x, “T” 3x, “Q” 4x, “p” 5x and “H” 6x interfaces of the given bandwidth.
```

Virtual network interface option	|Description (Bandwidth in Gbps)
---|---
n1, n10, n1T, n1Q, n1P, n1H	|1x 1, 2x 1, 3x 1, 4x 1, 5x 1, 6x 1 Gbps
n10, n10D, n10T, n10Q, n10P, n10H	|1x 10, 2x 10, 3x 10, 4x 10, 5x 10, 6x 10 Gbps
n25, n25D, n25T, n25Q, n25P, n25H	|1x 25, 2x 25, 3x 25, 4x 25, 5x 25, 6x 25 Gbps
n50, n50D, n50T, n50Q, n50P, n50H	|1x 50, 2x 50, 36x 50, 4x 50, 5x 50, 6x 50 Gbps
n100, n100D, n100T, n100Q, n100P, n100H	|1x 100, 2x 100, 3x 100, 4x 100, 5x 100, 6x 100 Gbps

##  4.3 Storage Extensions
Multiple non-ephemeral storage volumes can be attached to virtual computes  for persistent data storage. Each of those volumes can be configured with the required performance category.

.conf	|Read IO/s	|Write IO/s	Read |Throughput (MB/s)	|Write Throughput (MB/s)
---|---|---|---|---
.bronze	|Up to 3K	|Up to 15K	|Up to 180	|Up to 120
.silver	|Up to 60K	|Up to 30K	|Up to 1200	|Up to 400
.gold	|Up to 680K	|Up to 360K	|Up to 2650	|Up to 1400

<a name="4.4.2"></a>
### 4.4.2	N Instances (Network Intensive)
This instance type is intended to be used for those applications that has high network throughput requirements (up to 50Gbps). This instance type is more intended for VNFs and is expected to be available in regional (distributed) data centres and more towards the access networks.
