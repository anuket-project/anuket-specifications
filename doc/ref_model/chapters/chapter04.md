## 4.1 Capabilities and Performance Measurements

This section describes and uniquely identifies the Capabilities provided directly by the Infrastructure, as well as Performance Measurements (PMs) generated directly by the Infrastructure (i.e. without the use of external instrumentation).

The Capability and PM identifiers conform to the following schema:

**a.b.c.d** (Ex. "e.nfvi.pm.001")  
a = Scope <(e)xternal | (i)nternal | (t)hird_party_instrumentation>  
b = Functional Area<nfvi | vim>  
c = Type <(cap)ability | (pm)>  
d = Serial Number  

A spreadsheet in the artefact repository maintains the list of assigned identifiers, along with their respective descriptions and the next available identifier, globally across all chapters of the RM.

### 4.1.1 Exposed vs Internal

The following pertains to the context of NFVI Resources, Capabilities and Performance Measurements (PMs) as discussed within this chapter.

<b>Exposed:</b> Refers to any object (e.g., resource discovery/configuration/consumption, platform telemetry, Interface, etc.) that exists in or pertains to, the domain of the NFVI and is made visible (aka “Exposed”) to a VNF. When an object is exposed to a given VNF, the scope of visibility within a given VNF is at the discretion of the specific VNF’s designer. From an Infra perspective, the Infra-resident object is simply being exposed to one or more virtual environments (i.e. Workloads). It is then the responsibility of the kernel or supervisor/executive within the VM to control how, when and where the object is further exposed within the VM, with regard to permissions, security, etc. As the object(s) originate with the Infra, they are by definition visible within that domain.

<b>Internal:</b> Effectively the opposite of Exposed; objects Internal to the NFVI, which are exclusively available for use by the NFVI and components within the NFVI.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/Sect_3-2_Exposed_vs_Internal_Diagram_v2.jpg" alt="Exposed vs. Internal Scope" title="Exposed vs. Internal Scope" width="65%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 4-1:</b> Exposed vs. Internal Scope</p>

As illustrated in the figure above, objects designated as "Internal" are only visible within the area inside the blue oval (the NFVI), and only when the entity accessing the object has the appropriate permissions. Whereas objects designated as "Exposed" are potentially visible from both the area within the green oval (the Workload), as well as from within the NFVI, again provided the entity accessing the object has appropriate permissions.

Note: The figure above indicates the areas from where the objects are <i>visible</i>. It is not intended to indicate where the objects are <i>instantiated</i>. For example, the virtual resources are instantiated within the NFVI (the blue area), but are Exposed, and therefore are <i>visible</i> to the Workload, within the green area.

### 4.1.2 Exposed Infrastructure Capabilities

This section describes a set of explicit NFVI capabilities and performance measurements that define an NFVI. These capabilities and PMs are well known to VNFs as they provide capabilities which VNFs rely on.

> _**Note**:  It is expected that NFVI capabilities and measurements will expand over time as more capabilities are added and technology enhances and matures._

<a name="4.1.2.1"></a>
#### 4.1.2.1 Exposed Resource Capabilities

**Table 4-1** below shows resource capabilities of NFVI. Those indicate resources offered to VNFs by NFVI.

#### 4.1.2.2 Exposed Performance Optimisation Capabilities

**Table 4-2** shows possible performance optimisation capabilities that can be provided by NFVI. These indicate capabilities exposed to VNFs. These capabilities are to be consumed by VNFs in a standard way.

<a name="Table4-2"></a>

| Ref | NFVI Capability | Unit | Definition/Notes |
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| e.nfvi.cap.006 | CPU core pinning support | Yes/No | Indicates if NFVI supports CPU core pinning |
| e.nfvi.cap.007 | NUMA support | Yes/No | Indicates if NFVI supports NUMA |

| e.nfvi.cap.013 | SR-IOV over PCI-PT <sup>2)</sup> | Yes/No | Traditional SR-IOV |
| e.nfvi.cap.014 | GPU/NPU <sup>2)</sup> | Yes/No | Hardware coprocessor |
| e.nfvi.cap.015 | SmartNIC <sup>2)3)</sup> | Yes/No | Network Acceleration |
| e.nfvi.cap.016 | FPGA/other Acceleration H/W <sup>2)</sup> | Yes/No | Non-specific hardware |

<p align="center"><b>Table 4-2:</b> Exposed Performance Optimisation Capabilities of NFVI</p>

<sup>1)</sup> L and X cache policies require CPU pinning to be active.

<sup>2)</sup> These Capabilities generally require hardware-dependent drivers be injected into workloads, which is prohibited by CNTT principles. As such, use of these features shall be governed by the applicable CNTT policy. Please consult the RM Appendix for the usage policy relevant to any needed hardware Capability of this type.

<sup>3)</sup> SmartNICs that do not utilise PCI-PT are not subject to the Abstraction Principle, nor any related policies or prohibitions.

Enhanced Cache Management is a compute performance enhancer that applies a cache management policy to the socket hosting a given virtual compute instance, provided the associated physical CPU microarchitecture supports it. Cache management policy can be used to specify the static allocation of cache resources to cores within a socket. The "Equal" policy distributes the available cache resources equally across all of the physical cores in the socket. The "eXpanded" policy provides additional resources to the core pinned to a VNF that has the "X" attribute applied. The "Lean" attribute can be applied to VNFs which do not realize significant benefit from a marginal cache size increase and are hence willing to relinquish unneeded resources.

In addition to static allocation, an advanced Reference Architecture implementation can implement dynamic cache management control policies, operating with tight (~ms) or standard (10s of seconds) control loop response times, thereby achieving higher overall performance for the socket.

#### 4.1.2.3 Exposed Monitoring Capabilities

Monitoring capabilities are used for the passive observation of workload-specific traffic traversing the NFVI. As with all capabilities, Monitoring may be unavailable or intentionally disabled for security reasons in a given NFVI instance. If this functionallity is enabled, it must be subject to strict security policies. Refer to the Reference Model Security chapter for additional details.

**Table 4-3** shows possible monitoring capabilities available from the NFVI for VNFs.

### 4.1.4 Internal Infrastructure Capabilities

This section covers a list of implicit NFVI capabilities and measurements that define an NFVI. These capabilities and metrics determine how the NFVI behaves internally. They are hidden from VNFs (i.e. VNFs may not know about them) but they will impact the overall performance and capabilities of a given NFVI solution.

>_**Note**:  It is expected that implicit NFVI capabilities and metrics will evolve with time as more capabilities are added as technology enhances and matures._

<a name="4.1.4.1"></a>

## 4.2 Infrastructure Profiles Catalogue

Infrastructure exposes compute Flavours with options, virtual interface options, storage extensions, and acceleration extensions to VNFs. These NFVI Profiles are offered to VNFs in the form of infrastructure instance types with their corresponding options and extensions.

The idea of the infrastructure profiles catalogue is to have a predefined set of instance types with a predefined set of compute Flavours (sometimes referred to as T-shirt sizes) which VNF vendors use to build their VNFs. Each VNF uses one or more compute Flavour (with one or more of offered instance types) to build its overall functionality as illustrated in **Figure 4-2**.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch04_vnf_design.PNG" alt="vnf_design" title="VNF Design" width="65%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 4-2:</b> VNFs built against standard instance types and compute Flavours.</p>

<a name="4.2.1"></a>
### 4.2.1 Compute Flavours

Compute Flavours represent the compute, memory, storage, and management network resource templates that are used by VMs on the compute hosts. Each VM is given a compute Flavour (resource template), which determines the VMs compute, memory and storage characteristics.

Compute Flavours can also specify secondary ephemeral storage, swap disk, etc. A compute Flavour geometry consists of the following elements:

Element |Description
--------|----------
Compute Flavour Name |A descriptive name
Virtual compute resources (aka vCPUs) |Number of virtual compute resources (vCPUs) presented to the VM instance.
Memory |Virtual compute instance memory in megabytes.
Ephemeral/Local Disk |Specifies the size of an ephemeral data disk that exists only for the life of the instance. Default value is 0.<br />The ephemeral disk may be partitioned into boot (base image) and swap space disks.
Management Interface |Specifies the bandwidth of management interface/s

<p align="center"><b>Table 4-16:</b> Compute Flavour Geometry Specification.</p>

<a name="4.2.1.1"></a>
#### 4.2.1.1 Predefined Compute Flavours
The intent of the following Flavours list is to be comprehensive and yet effective to cover both IT and NFV workloads. The compute Flavours are specified relative to the “large” Flavour. The “large” Flavour configuration consists of 4 vCPUs, 8 GB of RAM and 80 GB of local disk, and the resulting instance will have a management interface of 1 Gbps. The “medium” Flavour is half the size of a large and small is half the size of medium. The tiny Flavour is a special sized Flavour.

>_*Note:*_ Customised (Parameterized) Flavours can be used in concession by operators and, if needed, are created using TOSCA, HEAT templates, and/or VIM APIs.

.conf |vCPU ("c") |RAM ("r") |Local Disk ("d") | Management Interface
-----|------------|----------|-----|-----
.tiny |1 |512 MB |1 GB |1 Gbps
.small |1 |2 GB |20 GB  |1 Gbps
.medium |2 |4 GB |40 GB |1 Gbps
.large |4 |8 GB |80 GB |1 Gbps
.2xlarge* |8 |16 GB |160 GB |1 Gbps
.4xlarge* |16 |32 GB |320 GB |1 Gbps
.8xlarge* |32 |64 GB |640 GB |1 Gbps

<p align="center"><b>Table 4-17:</b> Predefined Compute Flavours.</p>

> _*These compute Flavours are intended to be used for transitional purposes and VNF vendors are expected to consume smaller Flavours and adopt microservices-based designs for their VNFs_

<a name="4.2.2"></a>
### 4.2.2 Virtual Network Interface Specifications


The virtual network interface specifications extend a Flavour customization with network interface(s), with an associated bandwidth, and are identified by the literal, “n”, followed by the interface bandwidth (in Gbps). Multiple network interfaces can be specified by repeating the “n” option.

Virtual interfaces may be of an Access type, and thereby untagged, or may be of a Trunk type, with one or more 802.1Q tagged logical interfaces. Note, tagged interfaces are encapsulated by the Overlay, such that tenant isolation (i.e. security) is maintained, irrespective of the tag value(s) applied by the VNF.  

Note, the number of virtual network interfaces, aka vNICs, associated with an instance of a virtual environment, is directly related to the number of vNIC extensions declared for the environment. The vNIC extension is not part of the base Flavour.
```
<network interface bandwidth option> :: <”n”><number (bandwidth in Gbps)>
```

Virtual Network Interface Option |Interface Bandwidth
---|---
n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6 |1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Gbps
n10, n20, n30, n40, n50, n60 |10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 Gbps
n25, n50, n75, n100, n125, n150 |25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 Gbps
n50, n100, n150, n200, n250, n300 |50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 Gbps
n100, n200, n300, n400, n500, n600 |100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 Gbps

Persistent storage is associated with VNFs via Storage Extensions. The size of an extension can be specified explicitly in increments of 100GB, ranging from a minimum of 100GB to a maximum of 16TB. Extensions are configured with the required performance category, as per Table 4-19. Multiple persistent Storage Extensions can be attached to virtual compute instances.

Note, CNTT documentation uses GB and GiB to refer to a Gibibyte (2<sup>30</sup> bytes), except where explicitly stated otherwise.

.conf |Read IO/s |Write IO/s | Read Throughput (MB/s) |Write Throughput (MB/s) |Max Ext Size
---|---|---|---|---|---
.bronze |Up to 3K |Up to 1.5K |Up to 180 |Up to 120 |16TB
.silver |Up to 60K |Up to 30K |Up to 1200 |Up to 400 |1TB
.gold |Up to 680K |Up to 360K |Up to 2650 |Up to 1400 |1TB

## 4.3 Networking

This is a placeholder for NFVI infrastructure networking information that is common to all Reference Architectures.


## 4.4 Key Terminology, Definitions and Glossary (temporary)

This section is temporary while the team defines and aligns on key terms used in this chapter. When finalized, these definitions will be moved to the RM glossary appendix.

- **PM / Performance Measurement / Measurement:** The procedure or set of operations having the object of determining a Measured Value or Measurement Result. In this context, PMs reflect data generated and collected within the NFVI, that reflects the performance of the infrastructure. For example, a count of frames or packets traversing an interface, memory usage information, other resource usage and availability, etc. These data may be instantaneous or accumulated, and made available (i.e. exposed) based on permissions and contexts (e.g., workload vs. infra)

- **Monitoring (Capability):** Monitoring capabilities are used for the passive observation of workload-specific traffic traversing the NFVI. Note, as with all capabilities, Monitoring may be unavailable or intentionally disabled for security reasons in a given NFVI instance.

- PVP: Physical-Virtual-Physical; PVP represents a Workload test topology where a measurement is taken across two physical test points (e.g., physical NICs on a host), with traffic traversing a virtualized Workload that is logically connected between the physical points. PVP is an ETSI term, defined in [ETSI GS NFV-TST 009](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-TST/001_099/009/03.01.01_60/gs_NFV-TST009v030101p.pdf)

<!--
The following draft definition placeholders are in support of the new PM schema/description. They are currently commented out as alignment discussions are in progress. They are to be published when their language is finalized. -MXS
//
- Virtual Resources (aka “Resources”): Abstracted and isolated portions of physical resources, furnished to virtual environments such as VMs and containers. The most common examples of Virtual Resources include compute, storage and network.
//
- **Capabilities:** Potential ability of the infrastructure to furnish something, frequently a Resource, but potentially a feature or datum, to another entity. Capabilities in CNTT are divided into the following categories:
-	**(R)**esource: Compute (RAM/CPU), Storage, Network, etc.
-	**(F)**eature: NUMA, Acceleration, SMT, etc.
-	**(D)**ata: Describing attributes of the infrastructure, such as constraints, limits, etc.
//
- - **Resources and Features:** In the context of Capabilities, describes active aspects of infrastructure, which are directly applied to the task of operating a Workload. For example, some portion of the RAM Resource is applied to a given Workload, which in-turn will use it to store runtime data. Similarly, a Feature such as NUMA may be utilized by a Workload, to ensure the Workload’s access to the Workload’s RAM at runtime is as efficient as possible.
//
- - **Data:** Is passive and used to describe static aspects of the infrastructure, which may be determined at design time or otherwise in advance of runtime. For example, a Capability datum can represent the maximum number of virtual CPU cores a single VM can be allocated. The absolute maximum value for this Capability is determined by the physical CPU’s SKU, however, the value may be lowered arbitrarily by the infrastructure designer, to achieve various business or technical  objectives. In either case, the value is known before power is applied to the system, and does not change at run-time.
