Infrastructure Capabilities, Measurements and Catalogue
=======================================================

Capabilities and Performance Measurements
-----------------------------------------

This section describes the Capabilities provided by the Cloud Infrastructure, and the Performance Measurements (PMs)
generated by the Cloud Infrastructure (i.e., without the use of external instrumentation).

The Capability and PM identifiers conform to the following schema:

| **a.b.c** (E.g., "e.pm.001")
| a = Scope <(e)xternal \| (i)nternal \| (t)hird_party_instrumentation>
| b = Type <(cap) capability \| (man) management \| (pm) performance \| (man-pm)>
| c = Serial Number

Exposed vs Internal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following definitions specify the context of the Cloud Infrastructure Resources, Capabilities and Performance
Measurements (PMs).

**Exposed:** Refers to any object (e.g., resource discovery/configuration/consumption, platform telemetry, interface,
etc.) that exists in or pertains to, the domain of the Cloud Infrastructure and is made visible (aka “Exposed”) to a
workload. When an object is exposed to a given workload, the scope of visibility within a given workload is at the
discretion of the workload’s designer. From an infrastructure perspective, the Infra-resident object is simply being
exposed to one or more virtual environments (i.e., workloads). It is the responsibility of the kernel or
supervisor/executive within the resource instance (VM or container) to control how, when and where the object is further
exposed within the resource instance, with regard to permissions, security, etc. An object(s) is by definition visible
within its domain of origin.

**Internal:** Effectively the opposite of Exposed; objects are exclusively available for use within the Cloud
Infrastructure.

   :alt: "Exposed vs. Internal Scope"

   Exposed vs. Internal Scope

As illustrated in the figure above, objects designated as "Internal" are only visible within the area inside the blue
oval (the Cloud Infrastructure), and only when the entity accessing the object has the appropriate permissions. Whereas
objects designated as "Exposed" are potentially visible from both the area within the green oval (the Workloads), as
well as from within the Cloud Infrastructure, again provided the entity accessing the object has appropriate
permissions.

Note: The figure above indicates the areas from where the objects are *visible*. It is not intended to indicate where
the objects are *instantiated*. For example, the virtual resources are instantiated within the Cloud Infrastructure
(the blue area), but are Exposed, and therefore are *visible* to the Workloads, within the green area.

Exposed Infrastructure Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes a set of exposed Cloud Infrastructure capabilities and performance measurements. These
capabilities and PMs are well known to workloads as they provide capabilities which workloads rely on.

   **Note**\ *: It is expected that Cloud Infrastructure capabilities and measurements will expand over time as more
   capabilities are added and technology enhances and matures.*

**Table 4-2:** Exposed Performance Optimisation Capabilities of Cloud Infrastructure

Enhanced Cache Management is a compute performance enhancer that applies a cache management policy to the socket hosting
a given virtual compute instance, provided the associated physical CPU microarchitecture supports it. Cache management
policy can be used to specify the static allocation of cache resources to cores within a socket. The "Equal" policy
distributes the available cache resources equally across all of the physical cores in the socket. The "eXpanded" policy
provides additional resources to the core pinned to a workload that has the "X" attribute applied. The "Lean" attribute
can be applied to workloads which do not realise significant benefit from a marginal cache size increase and are hence
willing to relinquish unneeded resources.

In addition to static allocation, an advanced Reference Architecture implementation can implement dynamic cache
management control policies, operating with tight (~ms) or standard (10s of seconds) control loop response times,
thereby achieving higher overall performance for the socket.

Exposed Monitoring Capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Monitoring capabilities are used for the passive observation of workload-specific traffic traversing the Cloud
Infrastructure. As with all capabilities, Monitoring may be unavailable or intentionally disabled for security reasons
in a given Cloud Infrastructure deployment. If this functionality is enabled, it must be subject to strict security
policies. Refer to the Reference Model Security chapter for additional details.

**Table 4-3** shows possible monitoring capabilities available from the Cloud Infrastructure for workloads.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section covers a list of implicit Cloud Infrastructure capabilities and measurements. These capabilities and
metrics are hidden from workloads (i.e., workloads may not know about them) but they will impact the overall performance
and capabilities of a given Cloud Infrastructure solution.

Cloud Infrastructure Management Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cloud Infrastructure Manager (CIM) is responsible for controlling and managing the Cloud Infrastructure compute,
storage, and network resources. Resources are dynamically allocated based on workload requirements. This section covers
the list of capabilities offered by the CIM to workloads or service orchestrator.

**Table 4-9** shows capabilities related to resources allocation.

Acceleration/Offload API Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HW Accelerators and Offload functions with abstracted interfaces are preferred and can functionally be interchanged,
but their characteristics might vary. It is also likely that the CNFs/VNFs and the Cloud Infrastructure will have
certification requirements for the implementations. A SW implementation of these functions is also often needed to have
the same abstracted interfaces for the deployment situations when there are no more HW Accelerator or Offload resources
available.

For Accelerators and Offload functions with externally exposed differences in their capabilities or management
functionality, these differences must be clear through the management API either explicit for the differing functions or
implicit through the use of unique APIs.

Regardless of the exposed or internal capabilities and characteristics, the operators generally require a choice of
implementations for Accelerators and Offload function realisation, and, thus, the need for ease of portability between
implementations and vendors.

The following table of requirements are derived from the VNF/CNF applications, Cloud Infrastructure and Telco Operators
needs to have multiple realisations of HW Acceleration and Offload functions that can also be implemented through SW
when no special hardware is available. These requirements should be adopted in Reference Architectures to ensure that
the different implementations on the market are as aligned as possible in their interfaces and that HW Acceleration and
Offload functions get an efficient ecosystem of accelerators that compete on their technical merits and not through
obscure or proprietary interfaces.

**Table 4-12** shows Acceleration/Offload API Capabilities.

**Table 4-12:** Acceleration/Offload API Capabilities

Profiles and Workload Flavours
------------------------------

Section 4.1 enumerates the different capabilities exposed by the infrastructure resources. Not every workload is
sensitive to all listed capabilities of the cloud infrastructure. In Chapter 2, the analysis of the use cases led to the
definition of two :ref:`chapters/chapter02:profiles (top-level partitions)` and the need for specialisation
through :ref:`chapters/chapter02:profile extensions (specialisations)`. Profiles and Profile Extensions are
used to configure the cloud infrastructure nodes. They are also used by workloads to specify the infrastructure
capabilities needed by them to run on. Workloads would specify the
`flavours and additional capabilities <#workload-flavours-and-other-capabilities-specifications>`__ information.

In this section we will specify the capabilities and features associated with each of the defined profiles and
extensions. Each Profile (for example, :ref:`Cloud infrastructure Profiles`), and each Extension associated with that
profile, specifies a predefined standard set of infrastructure capabilities that workload vendors can use to build their
workloads for deployment on conformant cloud infrastructure. A workload can use several profiles and associated
Extensions to build its overall functionality as discussed below.

.. figure:: ../figures/RM-ch04-node-profiles.png
   :alt: Cloud infrastructure Profiles
   :name: Cloud infrastructure Profiles

   Cloud infrastructure Profiles

The two :ref:`chapters/chapter02:profiles, profile extensions & flavours` are:

::

   Basic (B): for Workloads that can tolerate resource over-subscription and variable latency.
   High Performance (H): for Workloads that require predictable computing performance, high network throughput and low
   network latency.

The availability of these two (2) profiles will facilitate and accelerate workload deployment. The intent of the above
profiles is to match the cloud infrastructure to the workloads most common needs, and allow for a more comprehensive
configuration using profile-extensions when needed. These profiles are offered with
`extensions <#profile-extensions>`__, that specify capability deviations, and allow for the specification of even more
capabilities. The Cloud Infrastructure will have nodes configured as with options, such as virtual interface options,
storage extensions, and acceleration extensions.

The justification for defining these two profiles and a set of extensible profile-extensions was provided in Section
:ref:`chapters/chapter02:profiles, profile extensions & flavours` and includes:

- Workloads can be deployed by requesting compute hosts configured as per a specific profile (Basic or High
  Performance)
- Profile extensions allow a more granular compute host configuration for the workload (e.g., GPU, high, speed network,
  Edge deployment)
- Cloud infrastructure "scattering" is minimised
- Workload development and testing optimisation by using pre-defined and commonly supported (telco operators) profiles
  and extensions
- Better usage of Cloud Objects (Memory; Processor; Network; Storage)

Workload flavours specify the resource sizing information including network and storage (size, throughput, IOPS).
:numref:`Workloads built against Cloud Infrastructure Profiles and Workload Flavours` shows three resources (VM or Pod)
on nodes configured as per the specified profile ('B' and 'H'), and the resource sizes.

.. figure:: ../figures/RM-ch-04-Workloads-Profiles-Flavours.png
   :name: Workloads built against Cloud Infrastructure Profiles and Workload Flavours
   :alt: Workloads built against Cloud Infrastructure Profiles and Workload Flavours

   Workloads built against Cloud Infrastructure Profiles and Workload Flavours

A node configuration can be specified using the syntax:

   <profile name>[.<profile_extension>][.<extra profile specs>]

where the specifications enclosed within "[" and "]" are optional, and the 'extra profile specs' are needed to capture
special node configurations not accounted for by the profile and profile extensions.

Examples, node configurations specified as: B, B.low-latency, H, and H.very-high-speed-network.very-low-latency-edge.

A workload needs to specify the configuration and capabilities of the infrastructure that it can run on, the size of the
resources it needs, and additional information (extra-specs) such as whether the workload can share core siblings (SMT
thread) or not, whether it has affinity (viz., needs to be placed on the same infrastructure node) with other workloads,
etc. The capabilities required by the workload can, thus, be specified as:

   <profile name>[.<profile_extension>][.<extra profile specs>].<workload flavour specs>[.<extra-specs>]

where the <workload flavour specs> are specified as defined in section
`4.2.4.3 Workload Flavours and Other Capabilities Specifications Format <#workload-flavours-and-other-capabilities-speci
fications-format>`__ below.

Profiles
~~~~~~~~

Basic Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hardware resources configured as per the Basic profile (B) such that they are only suited for workloads that tolerate
variable performance, including latency, and resource over-subscription. Only Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) is
configured on nodes supporting the Basic profile. With no NUMA alignment, the vCPUs executing processes may not be on
the same NUMA node as the memory used by these processes. When the vCPU and memory are on different NUMA nodes, memory
accesses are not local to the vCPU node and thus add latency to memory accesses. The Basic profile supports over
subscription (using CPU Allocation Ratio) which is specified as part of sizing information in the workload profiles.

High Performance Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The high-performance profile (H) is intended to be used for workloads that require predictable performance, high network
throughput requirements and/or low network latency. To satisfy predictable performance needs, NUMA alignment, CPU
pinning, and huge pages are enabled. For obvious reasons, the high-performance profile doesn’t support
over-subscription.

Profile Extensions represent small deviations from or further qualification of the profiles that do not require
partitioning the infrastructure into separate pools, but that have specifications with a finer granularity of the
profile. Profile Extensions provide workloads a more granular control over what infrastructure they can run on.

Workload Flavours and Other Capabilities Specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workload requests a set of resource capabilities needed by it, including its components, to run successfully.
The GSMA document OPG.02 "Operator Platform Technical Requirements" :cite:p:`gsmaopg02` defines "Resource Flavour" as this set of
capabilities. A Resource Flavour specifies the resource profile, any profile extensions, and the size of the resources
needed (workload flavour), and extra specifications for workload placement; as defined in
`Section 4.2 Profiles and Workload Flavours <#profiles-and-workload-flavours>`__ above.

This section provides details of the capabilities that need to be provided in a resource request. The
`profiles <#profiles>`__, the `profile specifications <#profiles-specifications--capability-mapping>`__ and the
`profile extensions <#profile-extensions>`__ specify the infrastructure (hardware and software) configuration. In a
resource request they need to be augmented with workload specific capabilities and configurations, including the
`sizing of requested resource <#workload-flavours-geometry-sizing>`__, extra specifications including those related to
the placement of the workload `section 4.2.4.2 <#workloads-extra-capabilities-specifications>`__, virtual network
`section 4.2.5 <#virtual-network-interface-specifications>`__ and storage extensions
`section 4.2.6 <#storage-extensions>`__.

Workload Flavours Geometry (Sizing)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Workload Flavours (sometimes also referred to as “compute flavours”) are sizing specifications beyond the capabilities
specified by node profiles. Workload flavours represent the compute, memory, storage, and network resource sizing
templates used in requesting resources on a host that is conformant with the profiles and profile extensions. The
workload flavour specifies the requested resource’s (VM, container) compute, memory and storage characteristics.
Workload Flavours can also specify different storage resources such as ephemeral storage, swap disk, network speed, and
storage IOPs.

Workload Flavour sizing consists of the following:

+-------------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Element     | Mnemonic | Description                                                                                 |
+=============+==========+=============================================================================================+
| cpu         | c        | Number of virtual compute resources (vCPUs).                                                |
+-------------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| memory      | r        | Virtual resource instance memory in megabytes.                                              |
+-------------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| storage     | e        | Specifies the size of an ephemeral/local data disk that exists only for the life of the     |
| - ephemeral |          | instance. Default value is 0. The ephemeral disk may be partitioned into boot (base image)  |
|             |          | and swap space disks.                                                                       |
+-------------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| storage -   | d        | Specifies the disk size of persistent storage.                                              |
| persistent  |          |                                                                                             |
+-------------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

**Table 4-12:** Workload Flavour Geometry Specification.

The flavours syntax consists of specifying using the <element, value> pairs separated by a colon (“:”). For example, the
flavour specification: {cpu: 4; memory: 8 Gi; storage-permanent: 80Gi}.

Workloads Extra Capabilities Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the sizing information, a workload may need to specify additional capabilities. These include
capabilities for workload placement such as latency, workload affinity and non-affinity. It also includes capabilities
such as workload placement on multiple NUMA nodes. The extra specifications also include the
`Virtual Network Interface Specifications <#virtual-network-interface-specifications>`__ and
`Storage Extensions <#storage-extensions>`__.

**Table 4-13:** Resource Flavours (complete list of Workload Capabilities) Specifications

Virtual Network Interface Specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The virtual network interface specifications extend a Flavour customisation with network interface(s), with an
associated bandwidth, and are identified by the literal, “n”, followed by the interface bandwidth (in Gbps). Multiple
network interfaces can be specified by repeating the “n” option.

Virtual interfaces may be of an Access type, and thereby untagged, or may be of a Trunk type, with one or more 802.1Q
tagged logical interfaces. Note, tagged interfaces are encapsulated by the Overlay, such that tenant isolation (i.e.,
security) is maintained, irrespective of the tag value(s) applied by the workload.

Note, the number of virtual network interfaces, aka vNICs, associated with a virtual compute instance, is directly
related to the number of vNIC extensions declared for the environment. The vNIC extension is not part of the base
Flavour.

Storage Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Persistent storage is associated with workloads via Storage Extensions. The storage qualities specified by the Storage
Extension pertain to "Platform Native - Hypervisor Attached" and "Platform Native - Container Persistent" storage types
(as defined in section "3.6.3 Storage for Tenant Consumption"). The size of an extension can be specified explicitly in
increments of 100GB (Table 4-15), ranging from a minimum of 100GB to a maximum of 16TB. Extensions are configured with
the required performance category, as per Table 4-15. Multiple persistent Storage Extensions can be attached to virtual
compute instances.

   *Note:* This specification uses GB and GiB to refer to a Gibibyte (2^30 bytes), except where explicitly stated
   otherwise.
