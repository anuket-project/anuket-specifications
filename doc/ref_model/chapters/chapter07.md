## 7.1 Introduction

This document includes process flow, logistics, and requirements which must be satisfied to ensure workloads meet the design, feature, and capability expectations of workload consumers to deliver cloud promoting the use and scalability of SDN capabilities. This chapter captures the core fundamentals and steps needed to conformance test workloads on target Cloud Infrastructure frameworks and architectures which drives more work into the community, resulting in pre-certified workloads on core capabilities ultimately reducing the amount of time and cost it takes each operator to on-board and maintain vendor provided workloads.

## 7.3 Common standards

Security vulnerabilities and attack vectors are everywhere.  The telecom industry and its cloud infrastructures are even more vulnerable to potential attacks due to the ubiquitous nature of the infrastructures and services combined with the vital role Telecommunications play in the modern world.   The attack vectors are many and varied, ranging from the potential for exposure of sensitive data, both personal and corporate, to weaponized disruption to the global Telecommunications networks.  The threats can take the form of a physical attack on the locations the infrastructure hardware is housed, to network attacks such as denial of service and targeted corruption of the network service applications themselves.  Whatever the source, any Cloud Infrastructure built needs to be able to withstand attacks in whatever form they take.

With that in mind, the Cloud Infrastructure reference model and the supporting architectures are not only required to optimally support networking functions, but they must be designed with common security principles and standards from inception.  These best practices must be applied at all layers of the infrastructure stack and across all points of interconnections with outside networks, APIs and contact points with the NFV network functions overlaying or interacting with that infrastructure.
Standards organizations with recommendations and best practices, and certifications that need to be taken into consideration include the following examples. However this is by no means an exhaustive list, just some of the more important standards in current use.

* Center for Internet Security - https://www.cisecurity.org/
* Cloud Security Alliance - https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/
* Open Web Application Security Project https://www.owasp.org
* The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (US Only)
* FedRAMP Certification https://www.fedramp.gov/ (US Only)
* ETSI Cyber Security Technical Committee (TC CYBER) - https://www.etsi.org/committee/cyber
* ETSI Industry Specification Group Network Functions Virtualisation (ISG NFV) - https://www.etsi.org/technologies/nfv
  * ETSI NFV ISG [SEC WG specifications](https://www.etsi.org/standards-search#page=1&search=NFV-SEC&title=0&etsiNumber=1&content=0&version=1&onApproval=0&published=1&historical=0&startDate=1988-01-15&endDate=2020-02-27&harmonized=0&keyword=&TB=&stdType=&frequency=&mandate=&collection=&sort=1)
* ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) - www.iso.org.  The following ISO standards are of particular interest for NFVI
  * ISO/IEC 27002:2013 - ISO/IEC 27001 is the international Standard for best-practice information security management systems (ISMSs).
  * ISO/IEC 27032 - ISO/IEC 27032is the international Standard focusing explicitly on cybersecurity.
  * ISO/IEC 27035 - ISO/IEC 27035 is the international Standard for incident management. Incident management
  * ISO/IEC 27031 - ISO/IEC 27031 is the international Standard for ICT readiness for business continuity.

A good place to start to understand the requirements is to use the widely accepted definitions developed by the OWASP – Open Web Application Security Project.  These include the following core principles:

* Confidentiality – Only allow access to data for which the user is permitted
* Integrity – Ensure data is not tampered with or altered by unauthorized users
* Availability – ensure systems and data are available to authorized users when they need it

Additional Cloud Infrastructure security principles that need to be incorporated:
* Authenticity – The ability to confirm the users are in fact valid users with the correct rights to access the systems or data.

<a name="7.3.1"></a>
## 7.3.1 Potential attack vectors
Previously attacks designed to place and migrate workload outside the legal boundaries were not possible using traditional infrastructure, due to the closed nature of these systems. However, using Cloud Infrastructure, violation of regulatory policies and laws becomes possible by actors diverting or moving an application from an authenticated and legal location to another potentially illegal location. The consequences of violating regulatory policies may take the form of a complete banning of service and/or an exertion of a financial penalty by a governmental agency or through SLA enforcement.  Such vectors of attack may well be the original intention of the attacker in an effort to harm the service provider. One possible attack scenario can be when an attacker exploits the insecure VNF API to dump the records of personal data from the database in an attempt to violate user privacy. Cloud Infrastructure operators should ensure that the applications APIs are secure, accessible over a secure network (TLS) under very strict set of security best practices, and RBAC policies to limit exposure of this vulnerability.

<a name="7.3.2"></a>
## 7.3.2 Testing demarcation points

It is not enough to just secure all potential points of entry and hope for the best, any Cloud Infrastructure architecture must be able to be tested and validated that it is in fact protected from attack as much as possible. The ability to test the infrastructure for vulnerabilities on a continuous basis is critical for maintaining the highest level of security possible.  Testing needs to be done both from the inside and outside of the systems and networks.  Below is a small sample of some of the testing methodologies and frameworks available.

• OWASP testing guide

• PCI Penetration testing guide

• Penetration Testing Execution Standard

• NIST 800-115

    o VULCAN: Vulnerability Assessment Framework for Cloud Computing (NIST)

• Penetration Testing Framework

• Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

• Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”)

• FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance (US Only)

• CREST Penetration Testing Guide

Insuring that the security standards and best practices are incorporated into the Cloud Infrastructure and architectures must be a shared responsibility, among the Telecommunications operators interested in building and maintaining the infrastructures in support of their services, the application vendors developing the network services that will be consumed by the operators, and the Cloud Infrastructure vendors creating the infrastructures for their Telecommunications customers.  All of the parties need to incorporate security and testing components, and maintain operational processes and procedures to address any security threats or incidents in an appropriate manner.  Each of the stakeholders need to contribute their part to create effective security for the Cloud Infrastructure.

<a name="7.4"></a>
## 7.4 Security Scope

<a name="7.4.1"></a>
## 7.4.1 In-scope and Out-of-Scope definition

The scope of the security controls requirements maps to the scope of the Reference Model architecture.

The Reference Model scope is shown below (as outlined in chapter 1 of the reference model):

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch09-etsi-nfv-architecture-mapping.png" alt="ETSI NFV architecture mapping" title="ETSI NFV architecture mapping" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-2:</b> ETSI NFV architecture mapping</p>

This means that the security of the Reference Model requirements must cover the virtual resources (including the virtualisation layer), the hardware resources, and the VIM (Virtualised Infrastructure Manager).

There will be a different set of security requirements for each Cloud Infrastructure reference architecture. In this case, the first reference architecture is OpenStack.

<a name="7.4.2"></a>
## 7.4.2 Security Requirements

The following diagram shows the different security domains that impact the Reference Model:

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch7_security_posture.png" alt="Overview" title="Security Domains" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-3:</b> Reference Model Security Domains</p>

<a name="7.4.2"></a>
## 7.4.3 Platform security requirements

At a high level, the following areas/requirements cover platform security for a particular deployment:
* Platform certification
* Secure access controls for administrators
* Secure API interface for Tenants
* Encryption for all external and control comms
* Strong separation between tenants - ensuring network, data, and runtime process isolation between tenants
* Authenticated/secure APIs provided to overlay network administrators
* Platform change control on hardware
* Templated approved changes for automation where available
* Typically well defined security framework documentation including approved deployment use cases
* Infrastructure software update process
* Identity Domain = platform

<a name="7.4.3"></a>
## 7.4.4 Workload security requirements

At a high level, the following areas/requirements cover workload security for a particular deployment:
* Up to platform-level certification
* Each workload network will need to undertake it own security self-assessment and accreditation, and not inherit a security accreditation from the platform
* Potentially automated service activation
* Workload owner owns workload security certification process
* Workload owner owns workload design change process
* Workload owner owns workload software update process
* Identity Domain = workload

<a name="7.4.4"></a>
## 7.4.5 Certification/validation requirements

    *(An overview/introduction to workload certification requirements and
    incl types of workloads covered)*

<a name="7.5"></a>
## 7.5 Platform Security

<a name="7.5.1"></a>
### 7.5.1 General Platform Security

The security certification of the platform will typically need to be the same, or higher, than the workload or VNF requirements.

The platform supports the workload, and in effect controls access to the workload from and to external endpoints such as carriage networks used by workloads, or by Data Centre Operations staff supporting the workload, or by tenants accessing workloads. From an access security perspective, the following diagram shows where different access controls will operate within the platform to provide access controls throughout the platform:

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch7-data-access-model.png" alt="Overview" title="Access Controls" width="100%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 7-4:</b> Reference Model Access Controls</p>

<a name="7.5.1.1"></a>
#### 7.5.1.1 The high-level functions of these different access controls

* **MGNT ACCESS CONTROLS** - Platform access to workloads for service management. Typically all management and control-plane traffic is encrypted.
* **DATA ACCESS CONTROLS** - Control of east-west traffic between workloads, and control of north-south traffic between the VNF and other platform services such as front-end carriage networks and platform services. Inherently strong separation between tenants is mandatory.
* **SERVICES ACCESS CONTROLS** - Protects platform services from any platform access
* **BACK-END ACCESS CONTROLS** - Data Centre Operations access to the platform, and subsequently, workloads. Typically stronger authentication requirements such as (Two-Factor Authentication) 2FA, and using technologies such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and encryption. Application Programming Interface (API) gateways may be required for automated/script-driven processes.
* **FRONT-END ACCESS CONTROLS** - Protects the platform from malicious carriage network access, and provides connectivity for specific workloads to specific carriage networks. Carriage networks being those that are provided as public networks and operated by carriers, and in this case with interfaces that are usually sub, or virtual networks.
* **TENANT ACCESS CONTROLS** - Provides apropriate tenant access controls to specific platform services, and tenant workloads - including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), authentication controls as approriate for the access arrangement, and Application Programming Interface (API) gateways for automated/script-driven processes.

<a name="7.5.1.2"></a>
#### 7.5.1.2 The following general security requirements apply to the platform

* Restrict traffic to (and from) the workload to only traffic that is necessary, and deny all other traffic.
* Provide protections between the Internet and any workloads including web and volumetrics attack preventions.
* Support zoning within a tenant workload - using application-level filtering.
* All host to host communications within the cloud provider network are to be cryptographically protected in transit.
* Not expose tenant IP address details to another tenant.
* Use cryptographically-protected protocols for administrative access to the platform.
* Data Centre Operations staff and systems must use management protocols that limit security risk such as SNMPv3, SSH v2, ICMP, NTP, syslog, and TLS.
* A platform change management process that is documented, well communicated to staff and tenants, and rigourously followed.
* A process to check change management adherence that is implemented, and rigourously followed.
* Processes for managing platform access control filters that are documented, followed, and monitored.
* No login to root on any platform systems (platform systems are those that are associated with the platform and include systems that directly or indirectly affect the viability of the platform).
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must apply for all platform systems access.
* An approved system or process for last resort access must exist for the platform.
* All API access must use TLS protocol.
* All production workloads must be separated from all non-production workloads including separation between non-hosted non-production external networks.
* Where there are multiple hosting facilities used in provision of the service, network communications between facilities for the purpose of backup, management, and application communication are cryptographically protected in transit between data centre facilities.
* Continuous cloud security compliance is mandatory.
* All data persisted to primary, replica, or backup storage is to be encrypted.
* All platform security logs are to be time synchronised.
* Logs are to be regularly scanned for events of interest.
* An incident response plan must exist for the platform.
* The cloud services must be regularly vulnerability and penetration tested.

### 7.5.2 Platform ‘back-end’ access security

* Restrict traffic to only traffic that is necessary, and deny all other traffic.
* Use cryptographically-protected protocols for administrative access to the platform.
* Data Centre Operations staff and systems must use management protocols that limit security risk such as SNMPv3, SSH v2, ICMP, NTP, syslog, and TLS.

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must apply for all systems access.
* An approved system or process for last resort access must exist for the platform.
* All back-end API access must use TLS.

<a name="7.5.3"></a>
### 7.5.3 Platform ‘front-end’ access security

* Front-end network security at the application level will be the responsibility of the workload, however the platform must ensure the isolation and integrity of tenant connectivity to front-end networks.
* The front-end network may provide (Distributed Denial Of Service) DDOS support.

<a name="7.6"></a>
## 7.6 Workload Security - Vendor Responsibility

<a name="7.6.1"></a>
### 7.6.1 Software Hardening

* No hard-coded credentials/ clear text passwords
* Software should be independent of the infrastructure platform (no OS point release dependencies to patch)
* Software is code signed and all individual sub-components are assessed and verified for EULA violations
* Software should have a process for discovery, classification, communication, and timely resolution of security vulnerabilities (i.e.; bug bounty, Penetration testing/scan findings, etc)

<a name="7.6.2"></a>
### 7.6.2 Port Protection

* Unused software and unused network ports should be disabled by default

<a name="7.6.3"></a>
### 7.6.3 Software Code Quality

* Vendors should use industry recognized software testing suites
  * Static and dynamic scanning
  * Automated static code review with remediation of Medium/High/Critical security issues. The tool used for static code analysis and analysis of code being released must be shared.
  * Dynamic security tests with remediation of Medium/High/Critical security issues. The tool used for Dynamic security analysis of code being released must be shared
  * Penetration tests (pen tests) with remediation of Medium/High/Critical security issues.
  * Methodology for ensuring security is included in the Agile/DevOps delivery lifecycle for ongoing feature enhancement/maintenance.

<a name="7.6.4"></a>
### 7.6.4 Alerting and monitoring

* Security event logging (All security events should be logged, including informational)
* Privilege escalation detection

  <a name="7.6.5"></a>

<a name="7.7"></a>
## 7.7 Workload Security  - Operator Responsibility.

The Operator’s responsibility is to not only make sure that security is included in all the vendor supplied infrastructure and NFV components, but it is also responsible for the maintenance of the security functions from an operational and management perspective.   This includes but is not limited to securing the following elements:

* Maintaining standard security operational management methods and processes
* Monitoring and reporting functions
* Processes to address regulatory compliance failure
* Support for appropriate incident response and reporting
* Methods to support appropriate remote attestation certification of the validity of the security components, architectures, and methodologies used

<a name="7.7.1"></a>
### 7.7.1 Remote Attestation/openCIT

Cloud Infrastructure operators must ensure that remote attestation methods are used to remotely verify the trust status of a given Cloud Infrastructure platform.  The basic concept is based on boot integrity measurements leveraging the TPM built into the underlying hardware. Remote attestation can be provided as a service, and may be used by either the platform owner or a consumer/customer to verify that the platform has booted in a trusted manner. Practical implementations of the remote attestation service include the open cloud integrity tool (Open CIT).   Open CIT provides ‘Trust’ visibility of the cloud infrastructure and enables compliance in cloud datacenters by establishing the root of trust and builds the chain of trust across hardware, operating system, hypervisor, VM, and container.  It includes asset tagging for location and boundary control. The platform trust and asset tag attestation information is used by Orchestrators and/or Policy Compliance management to ensure workloads are launched on trusted and location/boundary compliant platforms. They provide the needed visibility and auditability of infrastructure in both public and private cloud environments.

<a name="7.7.2"></a>
### 7.7.2 Workload Image Scanning / Signing

It is easy to tamper with workload images. It requires only a few seconds to insert some malware into a workload image file while it is being uploaded to an image database or being transferred from an image database to a compute node. To guard against this possibility, workload images can be cryptographically signed and verified during launch time. This can be achieved by setting up a signing authority and modifying the hypervisor configuration to verify an image’s signature before they are launched. To implement image security, the VNF operator must test the image and supplementary components verifying that everything conforms to security policies and best practices.

<a name="7.8"></a>
## 7.8 Application Vendors responsibility

The application vendors need to incorporate security elements to support the highest level of security of the networks they support.  This includes but is not limited to securing the following elements:

* Operating system or container
* Application
* Network interfaces
* Management and controller systems used to support the VNFs directly, examples include a SIEM system or a SD WAN policy manager
* Regulatory compliance failure as it relates to the application itself only

Image from https://www.networkworld.com/article/2840273/sdn-security-attack-vectors-and-sdn-hardening.html Will replace with a better image when I create it in the future.

<a name="7.9"></a>
## 7.9 Cloud Infrastructure and Cloud Infrastructure Manager Vendors responsibility

The Cloud Infrastructure vendors need to incorporate security elements to support the highest level of security of the infrastructure they support.  This includes but is not limited to securing the following elements:

* Hypervisor
* VM/container management system
* APIs
* Network interfaces
* Networking security zoning
* Platform patching mechanisms
* Regulatory compliance Failure

<a name="7.9.1"></a>
### 7.9.1 Networking Security Zoning

Network segmentation is important to ensure that VMs can only communicate with the VMs they are supposed to. To prevent a VM from impacting other VMs or hosts, it is a good practice to separate VM traffic and management traffic. This will prevent attacks by VMs breaking into the management infrastructure. It is also best to separate the VLAN traffic into appropriate groups and disable all other VLANs that are not in use. Likewise, VMs of similar functionalities can be grouped into specific zones and their traffic isolated. Each zone can be protected using access control policies and a dedicated firewall based on the needed security level.

Recommended practice to set network security policies following the principle of least privileged, only allowing approved protocol flows. For example, set 'default deny' inbound and add approved policies required for the functionality of the application running on the NFVI infrastructure.

<a name="7.9.2"></a>
### 7.9.2 Encryption

Virtual volume disks associated with workloads may contain sensitive data. Therefore, they need to be protected. Best practice is to secure the workload volumes by encrypting them and storing the cryptographic keys at safe locations. Be aware that the decision to encrypt the volumes might cause reduced performance, so the decision to encrypt needs to be dependent on the requirements of the given infrastructure.  The TPM module can also be used to securely store these keys. In addition, the hypervisor should be configured to securely erase the virtual volume disks in the event of application crashes or is intentionally destroyed to prevent it from unauthorized access.

* Composition analysis: New vulnerabilities are discovered in common open source libraries every week. As such, mechanisms to validate components of the VNF application stack by checking libraries and supporting code against the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases to determine whether the code contains any known vulnerabilities must be embedded into the NFVI architecture itself.  Some of the components required include:
* Tools for checking common libraries against CVE databases integrated into the deployment and orchestration pipelines.
* The use of Image scanners such as OpenSCAP to determine security vulnerabilities

<a name="7.9.3"></a>
### 7.9.3 Platform Patching

Cloud Infrastructure operators should ensure that the platform including the components (hypervisors, VMs, etc.) are kept up to date with the latest patch.

<a name="7.9.4"></a>
### 7.9.4 Boot Integrity Measurement (TPM)

Using a trusted platform module (TPM) as a hardware root of trust, the measurement of system sensitive components, such as platform firmware, bootloader, OS kernel, static filesystem, and other system components can be securely stored and verified.
NFVI Operators should ensure that the TPM support is enabled in the platform firmware, so that platform measurements are correctly recorded during boot time.

Additionally, NFVI Operators should ensure that OS kernel measurements can be recorded by using a TPM-aware bootloader (e.g. [tboot](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tboot/) or [shim](https://github.com/rhboot/shim)), which can extend the root of trust up to the kernel level.
The validation of the platform measurements can be performed by TPM’s launch control policy (LCP) or through the remote attestation server.

<a name="7.9.5"></a>
### 7.9.5 Runtime Integrity Measurement (TPM)
If a remote attestation server is used to monitor platform integrity, the operators should ensure that attestation is performed periodically or in a timely manner.
Additionally, platform measurements may be extended to monitor the integrity of the static filesystem at run-time by using a TPM aware kernel module, such as [Linux IMA (Integrity Measurement Architecture)](https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/) for linux platforms, or by using the [trust policies](https://github.com/opencit/opencit/wiki/Open-CIT-3.2-Product-Guide#88-trust-policies) functionality of OpenCIT.
The static filesystem includes a set of important files and folders which do not change between reboots during the lifecycle of the platform.
This allows the attestation server to detect any tampering with the static filesystem during the runtime of the platform.

<a name="7.9.6"></a>
### 7.9.6 Cloud Infrastructure & Cloud Infrastructure Manager

Resources management is essential. Requests coming from a higher orchestration layer to the Cloud Infrastructure manager must validated and the integrity of these requets must be verified.
