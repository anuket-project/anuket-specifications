There is the necessity to clearly define which kind of infrastructure resources a shared network function virtualisation infrastructure (NFVI) will provide for hosting workloads including virtual network functions (VNFs) and/or cloud-native network functions (CNF), so that the requirements of the workloads match the capabilities of the NFVI.

The lack of a common understanding of which resources and corresponding capabilities a suitable NFVI should provide may lead to several issues which could negatively impact the time and cost for on-boarding and maintaining these solutions on top of a virtualised infrastructure e.g.:

- supporting any kind of workload specific requirements (e.g. regarding network acceleration or API access) might result in having to establish different silo NFVIs for each workload type.
- synchronising the release cycles of a large set of different technologies will sooner or later lead to situations in which required upgrades cannot be applied easily due to incompatibilities.

The abstraction model presented in this chapter specifies a common set of virtual infrastructure resources which a NFVI will need to provide to be able to host most of the typical VNF/CNF workloads required by the operator community.
Although a couple of explicit and implicit abstraction models (e.g. in the context of ETSI/NFV) are already available they fall short when addressing the following design principles:
-	**Scope**: the model should describe the most relevant virtualised infrastructure resources (incl. acceleration technologies) an NFVI needs to provide for hosting Telco VNF workloads
-	**Separation of Concern**: the model should support a clear distinction between the responsibilities related to maintaining the network function virtualisation infrastructure and the responsibilities related to managing the various VNF workloads
-	**Simplicity**: the amount of different types of resources (including their attributes and relationships amongst one another) should be kept to a minimum to reduce the configuration spectrum which needs to be considered
-	**Declarative**: the model should allow for a declarative description of the required NFVI capabilities for on-boarding and maintaining workloads

-	**Explicit**: the model needs to be rich enough to allow for a direct mapping towards the APIs of NFVIs for the instantiation of virtual infrastructure elements without requiring any additional parameters
-	**Lifecycle**: the model must distinguish between resources which have independent lifecycles but should group together those resources which share a common lifecycle
-	**Aligned**: the model should clearly highlight the dependencies between the elements to allow for a well-defined and simplified synchronisation of independent automation tasks.

To summarise: the abstraction model presented in this document will build upon existing modelling concepts and simplify and streamline them to the needs of telco operators who intend to distinguish between infrastructure related and workload related responsibilities.

## 3.1	Model

The abstraction model for the NFVI makes use of the following layers (only the virtual infrastructure layer will be directly exposed to workloads such as VNFs/CNFs):

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/figure_3.1_NFVI-Model.png" alt="NFVI model_layers" Title="NFVI Model Layers" width="65%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 3-1:</b>Layers of the NFVI Model.</p>
  
The functionalities of each layer are as follows:
- Physical Infrastructure Resources: This layer consists of physical hardware components such as servers, (including random access memory, local storage, network ports, and hardware acceleration devices), storage devices, network devices, etc. and the basic input output system (BIOS).
- NFVI Software: This layer consists of both the host Operating System (OS) responsible for managing the physical infrastructure resources as well as the virtualization/containerization technology which, on request, dynamically allocates hardware components and exposes them as virtual resources.
- Virtual Infrastructure Resources: This layer represents all the infrastructure resources (compute, storage and networks) which the NFVI provides to the workloads such as VNFs/CNFs. These virtual resources can be managed by the tenants and tenant workloads directly or indirectly via an application programming interface (API).
- Workloads (VNFs/CNFs): This layer consists of workloads such as virtualized and/or containerized network functions that run on top of a VM or as a Container. The virtual infrastructure resources provided by the NFVI can be grouped into four categories as shown in the diagram in Figure 3-2.

The virtual infrastructure resources provided by the NFVI can be grouped into four categories as shown in the diagram below:

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/figure_3.2_Virtual_Infra_Resources.png" alt="virtual_resources" Title="Virtual Infrastructure Resources" width="65%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 3-2:</b> Virtual Infrastructure Resources provides virtual compute, storage and networks in a tenant context.</p>

- Tenants: represent an independently manageable logical pool of compute, storage and network resources
- Compute resources: represent virtualised computes for workloads and Operating and other Systems as necessary
- Storage resources: represent virtualised resources for persisting data
- Network resources: represent virtual resources providing layer 2 and layer 3 connectivity

The virtualised infrastructure resources related to these categories are listed below:

### Tenant

A network function virtualisation infrastructure needs to be capable of supporting multiple tenants and has to isolate sets of infrastructure resources dedicated to specific workloads (VNF/CNF) from one another. Tenants represent an independently manageable logical pool of compute, storage and network resources abstracted from physical hardware. **Example**: a tenant within an OpenStack environment or a Kubernetes cluster.

| Attribute | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`      | name of the logical resource pool                                                                       |
| `type`      | type of tenant (e.g. OpenStack tenant, Kubernetes cluster, …)                                           |
| `vcpus`     | max. number of virtual CPUs                                                                             |
| `ram`       | max. size of random access memory in GB                                                                 |
| `disc`      | max. size of ephemeral disc in GB                                                                       |
| `networks`  | description of external networks required for inter-domain connectivity                                 |
| `metadata`  | key/value pairs for selection of the appropriate physical context (e.g. location, availability zone, …) |

<p align="center"><b>Table 3.1:</b> Attributes of a tenant.</p>

### Compute
A virtual machine or a container/pod belonging to a tenant capable of hosting the application components of workloads (VNFs). A virtual compute therefore requires a tenant context and since it will need to communicate with other communication partners it is assumed that the networks have been provisioned in advance. **Example**: a virtual compute descriptor as defined in TOSCA Simple Profile for NFV.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | name of the virtual host |
| `vcpus` | number of virtual cpus |
| `ram` | size of random access memory in GB |
| `disc` | size of root disc in GB |
| `nics` | sorted list of network interfaces connecting the host to the virtual networks |
| `acceleration` | key/value pairs for selection of the appropriate acceleration technology |
| `metadata` | key/value pairs for selection of the appropriate redundancy domain |

<p align="center"><b>Table 3.2:</b> Attributes of compute resources.</p>

### Storage
A block device of a certain size for persisting information which can be created and dynamically attached to/detached from a virtual compute. A storage device resides in a tenant context and exists independently from any compute host. **Example**: an OpenStack cinder volume.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | name of storage resources |
| `size` | size of disc in GB |
| `attachments` | list of compute hosts to which the device is currently attached |
| `acceleration` | key/value pairs for selection of the appropriate acceleration technology |
| `metadata` | key/value pairs for selection of the appropriate redundancy domain |

<p align="center"><b>Table 3.3:</b> Attributes of storage resources.</p>

_**Comments**: we need to be more specific regarding acceleration and metadata._

### Network
A layer 2 / layer 3 communication domain within a tenant. A network requires a tenant context. **Example**: a virtual compute descriptor as defined in TOSCA Simple Profile for NFV.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | name of the network resource |
| `subnet` | network address of the subnet |
| `acceleration` | key/value pairs for selection of the appropriate acceleration technology |

## 3.2	Exposed vs Internal

The following pertains to the context of NFVI Capabilities, Metrics and Constraints, as discussed within this chapter.

<b>Exposed:</b> Refers to any mechanism (e.g., discovery, configuration, consumption, telemetry, some object, API, Interface, etc.) that exists in or pertains to, the domain of the NFVI and is made visible (aka “Exposed”) to a tenant and/or VNF in the workload domain. When an object is exposed to a given tenant or VNF, the scope of visibility within a given VNF is at the discretion of the specific VNF’s designer. From an Infra perspective, the Infra-resident object is simply being exposed to one or more virtual environments (i.e. VMs). It is then the responsibility of the kernel or supervisor/executive within the VM to control how, when and where the object is further exposed within the VM, with regard to permissions, security, etc. As the object(s) originate with the NFVI or Control Plane, they are by definition visible within those domains.

<b>Internal:</b> Effectively the opposite of Exposed; objects Internal to the NFVI, which are exclusively available for use by the NFVI and components within the NFVI control plane.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/Sect_3-2_Exposed_vs_Internal_Diagram_v2.jpg" alt="Exposed vs. Internal Scope" title="Exposed vs. Internal Scope" width="65%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 3-3:</b>Exposed vs. Internal Scope</p>

As illustrated in the figure above, objects designated as "Internal" are only visible within the area inside the blue oval (the NFVI), and only when the entity accessing the object has the appropriate permissions. Whereas objects designated as "Exposed" are potentially visible from both the area within the green oval (the Workload), as well as from within the NFVI, again provided the entity accessing the object has appropriate permissions.

Note: The figure above indicates the areas from where the objects are <i>visible</i>. It is not intended to indicate where the objects are <i>instantiated</i>. For example, the virtual resources are instantiated within the NFVI (the blue area), but are Exposed, and therefore are <i>visible</i> to the Workload, within the green area.

#### 3.4.2.2	Internal performance Metrics 
**Table 3-26** shows performance metrics of NFVI. Some of these metrics are related to what VNFs sees from the infrastructure and some of them are internal to NFVI. These metrics are aligned with ETSI GS NFV TST-009 [2].

| Ref | NFVI metrics | Unit | Definition/Notes |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| i.nfvi.per.met.001 | Network I/O East/West | Mpps @256Bytes | VNF-C to VNF-C within same platform. Do we need to expose it to VNF? |

| i.nfvi.per.met.004 | Network Latency | ms | ETSI NFV-TST 009[2]. |
| i.nfvi.per.met.005 | ephemeral storage IO | iops | Range (min, max) |
| i.nfvi.per.met.006 | ephemeral storage throughput | MB/s | Range (min, max) per VNF-C |

[COMMENT - Xavier Grall, Orange: section "3.4.2.3 Internal SLA metrics" is removed since it is redundant with network performance metrics]

[COMMENT - Xavier Grall, Orange: section "3.4.2.4 Internal scalability metrics" is removed since it is redundant with resource management metrics]

#### 3.4.2.1	Internal performance metrics 
[COMMENT - Xavier Grall, Orange: the mapping table is removed since those reference values will depend on architecture and implementation, and/or may be derived for different cases (eg w/ or w/o filtering rules for network throughput) ]

The following table shows performance metrics per NFVI node.

| Ref | NFVI metrics | Unit | Definition/Notes |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| i.nfvi.per.met.001 | Network throughput | bits/s or packets/s | Max throughput per node (aligned with ETSI GS NFV-TST 009 [2]) |
| i.nfvi.per.met.002 | Simultaneous active flows | number | Max simultaneous active L4 flows per node before a new flow is dropped |
| i.nfvi.per.met.003 | New flows rate               | flows/s  | Max new L4 flow rate per node                                |
| i.nfvi.per.met.004 | Processing capacity | test-specific | Processing capacity test-specific score per node |
| i.nfvi.per.met.005 | Energy consumption           | W                   | Maximum energy consumption of the node without hosting any VNF-C (but fully ready for it) |
| i.nfvi.per.met.006 | Network energy efficiency    | W/bits/s            | Energy consumption for the node max network throughput, normalized to the bit rate |
| i.nfvi.per.met.007 | Processing energy efficiency | W/core | Energy consumption during the node processing capacity measurement (i.nfvi.per.met.004), normalized to physical cores usable by VNF-C |

<p align="center"><b>Table 3-xx:</b> Internal performance metrics of NFVI.</p>

It should be noted that energy-related metrics must only be considered for NFVI software implementations benchmarking on a same NFVI hardware implementation (since energy consumption may be very different for a same processor model due to foundry process spread).

#### 3.4.2.2	Internal availability/reliability metrics

[COMMENT - Xavier Grall, Orange: the following table should be reviewed to only consider and probably detail the recovery-related metrics ; indeed, availability and MTBF metrics do not seem consistent with expected testbed measurement duration]

[COMMENT - Xavier Grall, Orange: the mapping table is removed since those reference values will depend on reference architecture and implementation]

| Ref | NFVI metric | Unit | Definition/Notes |
|--------------------|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| i.nfvi.arl.met.001 | Availability | % |  |
| i.nfvi.arl.met.002 | MTBF single node | days | Mean Time between Failure for single node |
| i.nfvi.arl.met.003 | MTBF AZ | days | Mean Time between Failure for an   AZ |
| i.nfvi.arl.met.004 | Recovery time | seconds |  |
