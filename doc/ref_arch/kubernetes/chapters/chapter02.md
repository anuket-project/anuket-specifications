## 2.1 Introduction

**must**: Requirements that are marked as _must_ are considered mandatory and must exist in the Reference Architecture and reflected in any Reference Implementation or Vendor Implementation targeting conformance with this Reference Architecture. The same applies to _must not_.

**should**: Requirements that are marked as _should_ are expected to be fulfilled by the Reference Architecture but it is up to each service provider to accept a Vendor Implementation targeting conformance with this Reference Architecture that is not reflecting on any of those requirements. The same applies to _should not_.

- ***NOTE:*** Some of these **must** and **should** requirements may be optional when it comes to an operator **deployment** (i.e. an operator may choose whether or not to deploy or not, depending on the NFVI Software Profiles required for each specific deployment). Specific requirements asking for the Reference Architecture to be flexible enough to allow that optionality will be added in the tables in section 2.3.

**may**: Requirements that are marked as _may_ are considered optional. The same applies to _may not_.

## 2.3 Kubernetes Architecture Requirements

The Reference Model (RM) defines the NFVI to consist of the physical resources, virtualised resources and a software managment system.  In the virtualised world, the NFVI Software Management System (Virtualised Infrastructure Manager -- VIM) consists of the Guest Operating System, Hypervisor and, if needed, other software such as libvirt.  And the VIM is responsible for, among others, tenant management, resources management, inventory, scheduling, and access management. Now consider, the containerisation equivalent.

Reference to "Architecture" in this chapter refers to the NFVI Hardware (e.g. physical resources), NFVI Software (e.g. Hypervisor, Container Runtime, virtual or container Orchestrator(s), Operating System), and infrastructure resources consumed by virtual machines or containers.
