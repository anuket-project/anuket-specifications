## 2.1 Introduction

This chapter will use the requirements defined in the overall Reference Model and only make additional entries in section [2.3](#2.3) if there are additional requirements needed for this Reference Architecture.

<a name="2.1.1"></a>
## 2.1.1 Definitions
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

<a name="2.2"></a>
## 2.2 Reference Model Requirements

The tables below contains the requirements from the Reference Model to cover the Basic and Network Intensive profiles.  The table also includes a reference to the specification from [Chapter 04 - Architecture Specification](./chapter04.md) to ensure traceability.

To ensure alignment with the infrastructure profile catalogue, the following requirements are referenced through:
- Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Software Profiles
- Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Hardware Profiles
- Those relating to Storage Extensions (S extension)
- Those relating to Network Acceleration Extensions (A extension)
- Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Management

> Note; where "(if offered)" is used in the Reference Model, this has been replaced with "Optional" in the table below in order to align with the RFC2119 wording.

## 2.3 Kubernetes Architecture Requirements

The Reference Model (RM) defines the Cloud Infrastructure, which consists of the physical resources, virtualised resources and a software management system.  In the virtualised world, the Cloud Infrastructure consists of the Guest Operating System, Hypervisor and, if needed, other software such as libvirt.  The Cloud Infrastructure Management component is responsible for, among others, tenant management, resources management, inventory, scheduling, and access management.

Now consider the containerisation equivalent, references to "Architecture" in this chapter refer to the Cloud Infrastructure Hardware (e.g. physical resources), Cloud Infrastructure Software (e.g. Hypervisor (optional), Container Runtime, virtual or container Orchestrator(s), Operating System), and infrastructure resources consumed by virtual machines or containers.

The requirements in this section are to be delivered in addition to those in [section 2.2](#2.2), and have been created to support the Principles defined in [Chapter 1 of this Reference Architecture](./chapter01.md).
