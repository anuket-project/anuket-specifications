Architecture Requirements
=========================

Introduction
------------

This chapter will specialise the requirements defined in the overall Reference Model into Kubernetes-specific
requirements. Additional, RA2-specific, entries are included in section
:ref:`chapters/chapter02:kubernetes architecture requirements`.

Definitions
-----------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 :cite:p:`rfc2119`.

Reference Model Requirements
----------------------------

The tables below contain the requirements from the Reference Model to cover all infrastructure profiles.
The table also includes a reference to any linked specification at
:ref:`chapters/chapter04:component level architecture` and at
:ref:`chapters/chapter05:security guidance` to ensure traceability. If the related Specification
does not exist, the reference will read "N/A" (and in bold "**N/A**" for mandatory requirements).

To ensure alignment with the infrastructure profile catalogue, the following requirements are referenced through:

-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Software Profiles
-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Hardware Profiles
-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Management
-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Security

Virtual Networking

**(1)** Might have other interfaces (such as SR-IOV VFs to be directly passed to a VM or a Pod) or NIC-specific drivers
on Kubernetes nodes.

**(2)** In Kubernetes based infrastructures network separation is possible without an overlay (e.g.: with IPVLAN)

**(3)** This feature is not applicable for Kubernetes based infrastructures due to lack of vSwitch however workloads
need access to user space networking solutions.

Edge Cloud Infrastructure Hardware Profile Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the case of Telco Edge Cloud Deployments, hardware requirements can differ from the above to account for
environmental and other constraints.
The Reference Model :cite:p:`refmodel`
includes considerations specific to deployments at the edge of the network. The infrastructure profiles "Basic" and
"High Performance" as per the RM chapter on `Profiles and Workload Flavours` still apply, but a number
of requirements of the above table are relaxed as follows:

Kubernetes Architecture Requirements
------------------------------------

The requirements in this section are to be delivered in addition to those in section `Reference Model
Requirements <#reference-model-requirements>`_, and have been
created to support the Principles defined in the :ref:`first chapter <chapters/chapter01:Overview>` of this
Reference Architecture.

The Reference Model (RM) defines the Cloud Infrastructure, which consists of the physical resources, virtualised
resources and a software management system.

In virtualisation platforms, the Cloud Infrastructure consists of the Guest Operating System, Hypervisor and, if
needed, other software such as libvirt. The Cloud Infrastructure Management component is responsible for, among others,
tenant management, resources management, inventory, scheduling, and access management.

With regards to containerisation platforms, the scope of the following Architecture requirements include the Cloud
Infrastructure Hardware (e.g. physical resources), Cloud Infrastructure Software (e.g. Hypervisor (optional), Container
Runtime, virtual or container Orchestrator(s), Operating System), and infrastructure resources consumed by virtual
machines or containers.
