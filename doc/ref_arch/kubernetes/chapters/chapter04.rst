Component Level Architecture
============================

Introduction
------------

This section describes in detail the Reference Architecture (RA2) for Kubernetes-based cloud infrastructure in terms
of the functional capabilities and how they relate to the Reference Model (RM)
requirements, that is, how the infrastructure profiles are determined, documented,
and delivered.

The specifications defined in this section will be detailed with unique
identifiers, which will follow the pattern: ``ra2.<section>.<index>``, for example,
``ra2.ch.001`` for the first requirement in the Kubernetes Node section. These
specifications will then be used as requirements input for the Reference Implementation based on RA2 specifications
(RI2) and any vendor or community implementations.

:numref:`Kubernetes Reference Architecture` below shows the architectural components that are described in the
subsequent sections of this chapter.

     - tbd
   * - ra2.os.002
     - Linux kernel version
     - A version of the Linux kernel that is compatible with kubeadm - this has been chosen as the baseline because
       kubeadm is focused on installing and managing the lifecycle of Kubernetes and nothing else, hence it is easily
       integrated into higher-level and more complete tooling for the full lifecycle management of the infrastructure,
       cluster add-ons, and so on.

   * - ra2.os.004
     - Disposable OS
     - In order to support gen.cnt.02 in :ref:`chapters/chapter02:Kubernetes Architecture Requirements` (immutable
       infrastructure), the Host OS must be disposable, meaning the configuration of the Host OS (and associated
       infrastructure such as VM or bare metal server) must be consistent - e.g. the system software and configuration
       of that software must be identical apart from those areas of configuration that must be different such as IP
       addresses and hostnames.

       .. note::

        Only containers in Guaranteed pods - where CPU resource requests and limits are identical - and configured
        with positive-integer CPU requests will take advantage of this. All other pods will run on CPUs in the remaining
        shared pool.

       nodes must be labeled according to the following pattern: an `anuket.io/profile/basic` label must be set to
       true on the worker node if it can fulfill the requirements of the basic profile and an
       `anuket.io/profile/network-intensive` label must be set to true on the worker node if it can fulfill the
       requirements of the high-performance profile. The requirements for both profiles can be found in

Storage components
------------------

For the storage solutions to be conformant with the Reference
Architecture they must be implemented according to the following specifications:

.. list-table:: Storage solution specifications
   :widths: 10 10 40 20 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Ref
     - Specification
     - Details
     - Requirement Trace
     - Reference Implementation Trace
   * - ra2.stg.001
     - Ephemeral storage
     - An implementation must support ephemeral storage, for the unpacked container images to be stored and executed
       from, as a directory in the filesystem on the worker node on which the container is running. See the
       `Container runtimes <#container-runtimes>`__ section above for more information on how this meets the requirement
       for ephemeral storage for containers.
     -
     -
   * - ra2.stg.002
     - Kubernetes Volumes
     - An implementation may attach additional storage to containers using Kubernetes Volumes.
     -
     -
   * - ra2.stg.003
     - Kubernetes Volumes
     - An implementation may use Volume Plugins (see ra2.stg.005 below) to allow the use of a storage protocol (such as
       iSCSI and NFS) or management APIs (such as Cinder and EBS) for the attaching and mounting of storage into a Pod.
     -
     -
   * - ra2.stg.004
     - Persistent Volumes
     - An implementation may support Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PV) to provide persistent storage for Pods.
       Persistent Volumes exist independent of the lifecycle of containers and/or pods.
     - :ref:`inf.stg.01 <chapters/chapter02:Kubernetes Architecture Requirements>`
     -
   * - ra2.stg.005
     - Storage Volume Types
     - An implementation must support the following Volume types: emptyDir, ConfigMap, Secret, and
       PersistentVolumeClaim. Other Volume plugins may be supported to allow for the use of a range of backend storage
       systems.
     -
     -
   * - ra2.stg.006
     - Container Storage Interface (CSI)
     - An implementation may support the Container Storage Interface (CSI), an Out-of-tree plugin. To support CSI, the
       feature gates CSIDriverRegistry and CSINodeInfo must be enabled. The implementation must use a CSI driver
       (full list of CSI drivers :cite:p:`k8s-csi-drivers`). An implementation may support ephemeral storage through a
       CSI-compatible volume plugin. In this case, the CSIInlineVolume feature gate must be enabled. An implementation
       may support Persistent Volumes through a CSI-compatible volume plugin. In this case, the CSIPersistentVolume
       feature gate must be enabled.
     -
     -
   * - ra2.stg.007
     -
     - An implementation should use Kubernetes Storage Classes to support automation and the separation of concerns
       between providers of a service and consumers of the service.
     -
     -



.. note::

    This Reference Architecture does not include any specifications for object
    storage, as this is neither a native Kubernetes object, nor something that is
    required by CSI drivers. Object storage is an application-level requirement
    that would ordinarily be provided by a highly scalable service offering, rather
    than being something an individual Kubernetes cluster could offer.

..

   Todo: specifications/commentary to support inf.stg.04 (SDS) and inf.stg.05 (high performance and
   horizontally scalable storage). Also sec.gen.06 (storage resource isolation), sec.gen.10 (CIS - if
   applicable) and sec.zon.03 (data encryption at rest).

Service meshes
--------------

Application service meshes are not in the scope of the architecture. The service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure
layer for handling service-to-service communication. It is recommended to secure service-to-service communications
within a cluster and to reduce the attack surface. The benefits of the service mesh framework are described in
:ref:`chapters/chapter05:use transport layer security and service mesh`. In addition to securing communications, the
use of a service mesh extends Kubernetes capabilities regarding observability and reliability.

Network service mesh specifications are handled in `Networking solutions <#networking-solutions>`__.

Kubernetes Application package manager
--------------------------------------

For the application package managers to be conformant with the Reference
Architecture, they must be implemented according to the following specifications:
