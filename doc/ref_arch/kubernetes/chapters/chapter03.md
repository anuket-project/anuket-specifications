## 3.1 Introduction

The CNTT Kubernetes Reference Architecture (RA) aims to provide an industry standard reference architecture independent of the many Kubernetes offerings and distributions. The RA does not seek to require vendor-specific enhancements in order to achieve CNTT conformance; conformance is achieved using upstream components or features that are developed by the open source community. This would allow operators to provide a common Kubernetes-based architecture that allows any conformant VNF or CNF to be deployed and operated as expected. The purpose of this chapter is to outline all the components required to provide Kubernetes in a consistent and reliable way.

Kubernetes is already very well documented at [https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) so rather than repeat content from there this and following chapters will describe the specific features used and how we expect them to be implemented.

This reference architecture provides optionality in terms of pluggable components such as service mesh and other plugins that might be used, however the focus of the reference architecture is on the abstracted interfaces and features that are required for workload management and execution.

Chapter 5 of the Reference Model (RM) describes the [hardware](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#5.3) and [software](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#5.1) profiles, which are descriptions of the capabilities and features that the NFVI offer to the workloads. As of v2.0, Figure 5-3 in the RM (also shown below) depicts a high level view of the software profile features that apply to each instance profile (Basic and Network Intensive). For more information on the instance profiles please read [RM Chapter 4, section 4.2.4](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter04.md#4.2.4).

These features and capabilities that are described in the software and hardware profiles are considered throughout this RA, with traceability of the RA requirements to the RM requirements formally captured in [chapter 2, section 2.2](./chapter02.md#2.2) of this RA.

## 3.2 Infrastructure Services

> This chapter shall list the services provided by the infrastructure. Some example of these services can be: log collection, monitoring, health check, load balancer. For the shake of clarity CaaS services should be also listed, like container lifecycle management or networking services.

<a name="3.2.1"></a>
### 3.2.1 Container Compute Services

> This chapter should describe considerations about container compute services.

The primary interface between the Physical / Virtual Infrastructure and any container-relevant components is the Host Operating System.  This is the OS within which the container runtime exists, and within which the containers run (and therefore, the OS whose kernel is shared by said containers).  This is shown in Figure 3-1 below.

<p align="center"><img src="../figures/ch03_hostOS.png" alt="Kubernetes Host Operating System" Title="Kubernetes Host Operating System" width="65%"/></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 3-1:</b> Kubernetes Host Operating System</p>

The Host OS (as with any OS) consists of two main layers:
- Kernel space
- User space

The Kernel is the tightly controlled space that provides an API via system calls to applications running in the user space (which usually have their own southbound interface in an interpreter or libraries).  Key containerisation capabilities such as Control Groups (cgroups) and namespaces are kernel features, and are used and managed by the container runtime in order to provide isolation between the user space processes (of which the container itself is one, and the processes running within the container are also).  The Host OS is key therefore to the overall security posture and must be appropriately secured to ensure processes running in one container cannot escalate their privileges, for example (covered further in [chapter 6](./chapter06.md)).

A key thing to note is that the container runtime itself is also a set of processes that run in user space, and interact with the kernel via system calls as well.  Many diagrams will show containers as running on top of the runtime, or inside the runtime.  More accurately, the containers themselves are simply some processes running within an OS, and the container runtime is another set of processes that are used to manage those containers (pull, run, delete, etc.) and the kernel features required to provide the isolation (cgroups, namespaces, filesystems, etc.).

#### 3.2.1.1 Memory management

> This chapter should describe considerations about memory management, like Huge Pages.

> Relate back to features described in the RM [here](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#521-virtual-compute). Note that the RM appears to be missing Memory-based HW profile features [here](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#54-nfvi-hw-profiles-features-and-requirements).

The Reference Model requires the support of Huge Pages in `nfvi.com.cfg.004` which is supported by upstream Kubernetes already. In case of some applications the Huge Pages should be allocated with the considerations of the HW topology. This later feature is missing from Kubernetes, therefore a gap was added to [Chapter 8.2.8](./chapter08.md/#8.2.8)

#### 3.2.1.2 HW Topology management

> This chapter should describe considerations about hardware topology management.

<a name="3.2.1.3"></a>
#### 3.2.1.3 HW Acceleration

> This chapter should describe considerations about hardware acceleration, like device management.

<a name="3.2.1.4"></a>
#### 3.2.1.4 CPU management

> This chapter should describe considerations about CPU management.

> Relate back to features described in the RM [here](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#521-virtual-compute) and [here](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#54-nfvi-hw-profiles-features-and-requirements).

#### 3.2.1.5 Container Runtime Services

The Container Runtime is the component that runs within a Host Operating System (OS) and manages the underlying OS functionality, such as cgroups and namespaces (in Linux), in order to provide a service within which container images can be executed and make use of the infrastructure resources (compute, storage, networking and other I/O devices) abstracted by the Host OS, based on API instructions from the kubelet.

There are a number of different container runtimes. The simplest form, low-level container runtimes, just manage the OS capabilities such as cgroups and namespaces, and then run commands within those cgroups and namesapces. An example of this type of runtime is runc, which underpins many of the high-level runtimes and is considered a reference implementation of the [Open Container Initiative (OCI) runtime spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec). This specification includes detail on how an implementation (i.e. an actual container runtime such as runc) must, for example, configure resource shares and limits (e.g. CPU, Memory, IOPS) for the containers that Kubernetes (via the kubelet) schedules on that host. This is important in ensuring the features and capabilities described in [chapter 5 of the RM](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md) are delivered by this RA and any subsequent Reference Implementations (RIs) to the instance types defined in the RM.

Where low-level runtimes are focused on the execution of a container within an OS, the more complex/complete high-level container runtimes focus on the general management of container images - getting them from somewhere, unpacking them, and then passing them to the low-level runtime, which then executes the container. These high-level runtimes also include a comprehensive API that other applications (e.g. Kubernetes) can use to interact and manage containers. An example of this type of runtime is containerd, which provides the features described above, before passing off the unpacked container image to runc for execution.

When it comes to Kubernetes, the important interface that we need to consider for container management is the [Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes/), which is an interface specification for any container runtime to be able to integrate with the kubelet on a Kubernetes Node. The CRI decouples the kubelet from the runtime that is running in the Host OS, meaning that the code required to integrate kubelet with a container runtime is not part of the kubelet itself (i.e. if a new container runtime comes along, and it uses CRI, it will work with kubelet). Examples of this type of runtime include containerd (with cri plugin) and cri-o, which was built specifically for Kubernetes.

### 3.2.2 Container Networking Services

Because `req.inf.ntw.01` requires the architecture to support CNI and `req.inf.ntw.16` requires the capability to attach several network interfaces to the pods the architecture must support a CNI metaplugin/CNI multiplexer.

A CNI metaplugin/CNI multiplexer is capable to attach several interfaces, using different other CNI plugins, to a pod. The different network characteristics of the interfaces, which require different networking technologies require different CNI plugins.

Inter node communication required by `req.inf.ntw.02` must be served by a CNI plugin which complies with the default K8s networking assumptions.

There are two types of low latency and high throughput networks required by `req.inf.ntw.04`. Network used for signalling traffic are more demanding than what an overlay network can handle, but still does not need the usage of user space networking. Due to the nature of signalling protocols used, this type of networks require the NAT-less communication stated by `req.inf.ntw.03`. Due to the combination of these two requirements networks with these characteristics must be served by a CNI plugin with IPVLAN or MACVLAN support.

The low latency, high throughput networks for handling the user plane traffic require the capability to use an user space networking technology.

> Note: An infrastructure can provide the possibility to use SR-IOV with DPDK as an additional feature and still be conformant with CNTT.

> Editors note: The possibility to SR-IOV for DPDK is under discussion.

As `req.inf.ntw.14` mandates the architecture must enable the integration of different SDN solutions via their respective CNI integration.

> Note: An SDN solution can manage the pod networks via the Kubernetes API or can have a CNI integration.

The architecture must support telecom equipment networking where the CNF networks are set up by the operator's network administrators. This is why, as `req.inf.ntw.10` requires, the architecture must provide a set of abstract management API-s to manage the network connectivity of the CNF pods.
The API must support multiple tenants and must require elevated acces rights to manipulate infrastructure related API objects as these operations require reconfiguration of the physical network infrastructure.

To fullfill the requirements of `req.inf.acc.02` the architecture must support the usage of device plugins via the Device Plugin API and the alignment of the devices, CPU topology and Huge Pages must be supported using the [Topology Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/).

The architecture must support both IPv4, IPv6 and dual stack interfaces of the workloads.

As Kubernetes Ingress, Egress and Services have no support for all the protocols needed in telecommunication environments (Diameter, SIP, LDAP, etc) and their capacity is limited, the architecture must enable the usage of alternative load balancers, like external or built into the application. Management of external load balancers must be possible via Kubernetes API objects.

The well known service meshes are "application service meshes" and deal with the application layer 7 protocols (eg.: HTTP) only. Therefore, their support is not required in the architecture.

### 3.2.3 Container Storage Services

Containers, when running, will require ephemeral storage on which to run themselves (i.e. storage on which the unpacked container image is stored and executed from). This ephemeral storage lives and dies with the container and is a directory on the worker node on which the container is running.  Note, this means that the ephemeral storage is mounted locally in the worker node filesystem. The filesystem can also be physically external to the worker node (e.g. iSCSI, NFS, FC) but the container will still reference it as part of the local filesystem.

Additional storage can also be attached to a container through the use of Kubernetes Volumes - this can be storage from the worker node filesystem (through hostPaths - not recommended), or it can be external storage that is accessed through the use of a Volume Plugin. Volume Plugins allow the use of a storage protocol (e.g. iSCSI, NFS) or management API (e.g. Cinder, EBS) for the attaching and mounting of storage into a Pod. This additional storage, that is attached to a container using a Kubernetes Volume, does not live and die with the container but instead follows the lifecycle of the Pod that the container is a part of. This means the Volume persists across container restarts, whilst the Pod is still running. However it does not necessarily persist when a Pod is destroyed, and therefore cannot be considered suitable for persistent data scenarios. The lifecycle of the actual data depends on the Volume Plugin used, and sometimes the configuration of the Volume Plugin.

For those scenarios where data persistence is required, Persistent Volumes (PV) are used in Kubernetes. PVs are resources in a Kubernetes Cluster that are consumed by Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and have a lifecycle that is independent of any Pod that uses the PV. A Pod will use a PVC as the volume in the Pod spec; a PVC is a request for persistent storage (a PV) by a Pod. By default, PVs and PVCs are manually created and deleted.

Kubernetes also provides an object called Storage Class, which is created by cluster administrators and maps to storage attributes such as quality-of-service, encryption, data resilience, etc. Storage Classes also enable the dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes (as opposed to the default manual creation). This can be beneficial for organisations where the administration of storage is performed separately from the administration of Kubernetes-based workloads.

There are no restrictions or constraints that Kubernetes places on the storage that can be consumed by a workload, in terms of the requirements that are defined in RM sections [5.2.2](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#522-virtual-storage) (software) and [5.4.2](../../../ref_model/chapters/chapter05.md#542-storage-configurations) (hardware). The only point of difference is that Kubernetes does not have a native object storage offering, and this RA is not looking to address this capability directly.

### 3.2.4 Kubernetes Application package manager

To manage complex applications consisting of several Pods the reference architecture must provide support for a Kubernetes Application package manager. The package manager may be able to manage the lifecycle of a set of Pods and provide a framework to customise a set of parameters for their deployment. The requirement on this Reference Architecture is to provide the Kubernetes API in conformance with the CNCF Conformance test for the package managers to use in the lifecycle management of the applications they manage. The Reference Architecture does not recommend the usage of a Kubernetes Application package manager with a server side component installed to the Kubernetes cluster (e.g.: Tiller).
