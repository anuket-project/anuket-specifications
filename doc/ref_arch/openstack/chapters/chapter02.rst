Architecture Requirements
=========================

Introduction
------------

**must**: Requirements that are marked as *must* are considered
mandatory and must exist in the reference architecture and reflected in
any implementation targeting this reference architecture. The same
applies to *must not*.

**should**: Requirements that are marked as *should* are expected to be
fulfilled by the reference architecture but it is up to each service
provider to accept an implementation targeting this reference
architecture that is not reflecting on any of those requirements. The
same applies to *should not*. > RFC2119

**may**: Requirements that are marked as *may* are considered optional.
The same applies to *may not*.

This chapter includes both "Requirements" that must be satisifed in an
RA-1 conformant implementation and "Recommendations" that are optional
for implementation.

Reference Model Requirements
----------------------------

The tables below contain the requirements from the Reference Model to
cover the Basic and High-Performance profiles.

To ensure alignment with the infrastructure profile catalogue, the
following requirements are referenced through:

-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Software Profiles
-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Hardware Profiles
-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Management
-  Those relating to Cloud Infrastructure Security
