## 1.3 Principles

Principles should apply to all reference architectures we design and develop

1. Principles should apply to all reference architectures we design and develop
1. Traceability between reference model to reference architecture (and vice versa)
1. Implementable and usable for VNF developer community, i.e. with enough specificity to support the design and development of a VNF 
1. Define the NFVI so that developers can understand how to build VNFs
1. Design the architectures with common elements so that the VNFs require less operator specific customizations
1. Rationalize need for each discrete architecture
    1. Intention is to minimize the number of discrete reference architectures
1. Architectures should be:
    1. Resilient
    1. Scalable
    1. Elastic
    1. Secure
    1. Low Latency
    1. Resource and Operational Efficiency
    1. E2E Lifecycle Automation (Deployment, Operations, & Maintenance)
    1. High-Availability
1. Prioritize incorporation of open source components 
    1. Design architectures to established open standards as much as possible
1. Architectures will evolve over time
