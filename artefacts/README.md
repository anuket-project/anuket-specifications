## 1 Usage of figures

- Figures used in the document should be in Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format
- Figures must be stored in the `figures` folder of the document where the figures are used (e.g.: `doc/ref_arch/figures/`)
- File name of the figures shold contain the chapter number where the figure is used as a prefix
- Every figure used in the documents should have an editable version commited to the repository in `ppt(x)` or in `svg` format
- Editable versions should be stored in the `figures/artefacts` folder of the document where the figures are used (e.g.: `doc/ref_arch/figures/artefacts`)
- Each figure's aditable version should be stored in a separate file with the same file name, but different extension, as the figure itself
