## How to contribute
- Contributions are made in the form of Pull Requests clidk [here](../artifacts/CNTT_GitHub_Technical_WG_Process.pptx) for how to create it.
- Any contribution contnet should align with CNTT [principles](../doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter01.md#1.4) and [Terminologies](../doc/ref_model/chapters/chapter01.md#1.3).

### Contributing guidelines
- Pull Requests should clearly speceify the Chapter and the section number in the title.
  - Please use also the description field to clarify the nature of your contribution.
- It is highly advised to check if there is a Pull Request already in place for the chapter/section you would like to contribute to.
