### Labels
Every Issue and PR should be tagged with one or more of the following labels to indicate their status and for the automation pipelines to apply the correct CNTT processes.

  - **Backlog**: The Issue will be addressed in future releases..
  - **Major/Minor**: The Issue or PR concerns a major or minor change.. 
  - **WIP**: The PR is still being developed and no reviews/approvals are expected yet.
     - PRs can also be created as "Draft" indicate that the PR is working in progress.
  - **Returned**: The issue/PR has been sent back to author (e.g. more information needed, not a high priority, no longer valid, etc). Only WSL or TSL can tag an issue/PR as Returned.
  - **Idle**: This label will be **automatically** applied (by a GitHub work flow or by WSL/TS Leads) to both issues/PRs to indicate that no activity has been observed on the issue/PR for some determined time frame. This triggers an action to close the issue/PR.
  - **Unresolved**: This label will be **automatically** applied to PRs to indicate that no consensus has been reached on the PR. This triggers an action to resolve the PR by the TSC.
  - **Forced**: This label will be **automatically** applied to PRs to indicate that the PR has been merged without following the default process (due to reasons identified below)

- Upon Creation, Issues must be correctly set with the correct **Project Name**. 
  - Project Name = Workstream Name.
- Issues must be correctly set with the right labels and Milestone by WSL.
  - Relevant Milestone for the upcoming release (M1 - M6).
- Contributors can assign an unassigned issue to themselves if they would like to work on them
- Workstream Leads have the responsibility to assign stalling or priority issues to individuals to address them.

### Pull Requests
- PRs must only be created when there is an issue present and a decision to create a PR is made. A PR must reference the issue it is resolving in the description field.
  - using GitHub predefined keyword "**Fixes Issue#**" will automatically close the issue which the PR is resolving when it is merged.
- A PR for an issues must only be created by the contributor assigned to the issue by the respective WSL.
- Only the person assigned ("assignee") to a PR may edit it. The normal process is for others to make suggests in "Comments" but not directly edit a PR unless the assignee has granter another contributor permission to contribute directly to the PR.
- A PR is recommended to only create/modify content within the scope of a single workstream.
- A PR should only add/change content related to the issue associated with the PR.
- Comments/sub-Conversations within a PR may only be marked Resolved by:
  - A) The originator of the sub-conversation. 
  - B) The relevant WSL or 
  - C) An automated timeout of 48hrs when there has been no additional comments after an update is posted to resolve the sub-thread. 
  - **The person responding to a sub-conversation shall not mark it as Resolved**.
- All changes to an existing PRs shall be made through subsequent commits. 
  - **Do not modify an existing commit, create separate commits under the same PR**.
  - PRs will be merged using "Squash and Merge" to enforce a linear commit history.

### Pull Requests Approval Process

- Once a PR is created, it needs to get the following approvals before it is merged into master.
  - From at least one of contributor for that workstream
    - Approvers should be distributed equally among operators and vendors.
  - From WSL (to make sure consensus is reached).
  - WSL can request additional approvals reviews.
    - Recommendation is to use 4 approvals for complex PRs.
  - 2 business days cool off period should be applied before Final approval.
  - Final Approval by TSL (to make sure process is followed)
- Only One approval will be counted per each organization for a given PR.
- The selection of which contributor to approve a PR is made by the WSL and should take those factors into consideration:
  - Contributor needs to be actively discussing the PR to be selected for approval.
- PRs will be merged automatically online by the TSL once consensus is reached and all approvals are received. 
- If WSL is the person who is creating the PR, They need to request an alternate approver, preferably from the co-lead or from the contributors list.

- No engagement/activity (content, reviews, conversations) from author, reviewers and workstream contributors on non-merge ready PRs for 15 calendar days.
  - Personal holidays or public holidays will not be counted.
- One or more identified Reviewers (including WSL) are not providing feedback/resolutions or approving the Pull Request for more than 15 calender days.

Any Pull Requests that are labeled as "Idle" will be discussed during Technical Steering Meeting to take a decision on, such as:
- Close the PR and label it as "**Returned**".
- "**Force**" Merging of the PR without having full reviewers approvals due to their inactivity.

### Unresolved Pull Requests Policy

Pull Requests will be automatically labled as "**Unresolved**" (by GitHub automation flow or a similar automation mechanism) when no consensus is reached during approval process.

Any Pull Requests that are labeled as "**Unresolved**" will be discussed during Technical Steering Comitee Meeting to take a decision on it by:
- Finding Common Grounds to come to consensus.
- Follow Governance Procedures to get consensus via voting mechanisms.
